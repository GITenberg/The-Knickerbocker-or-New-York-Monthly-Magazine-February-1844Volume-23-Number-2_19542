	<h2 class="title">SICILIAN SCENERY AND ANTIQUITIES.</h2>
	<h3 class="byline">BY THOMAS COLE.</h3>
	<p><span class="first_word">A few</span> months only have elapsed since I travelled over the classic land
	of Sicily; and the impressions left on my mind by its picturesqueness,
	fertility, and the grandeur of its architectural remains, are more
	vivid, and fraught with more sublime associations, than any I received
	during my late sojourn in Europe. The pleasure of travelling, it seems
	to me, is chiefly experienced after the journey is over; when we can
	sit down by our own snug fire-side, free from all the fatigues and
	annoyances which are its usual concomitants; and, if our untravelled
	friends are with us, indulge in the comfortable and harmless vanity of
	describing the wonders and dangers of those distant lands, and like
	Goldsmith&#8217;s old soldier, &#8216;Shoulder the crutch and <em>show</em> how fields
	were won.&#8217; I was about to remark, that those who travel only in books
	travel with much less discomfort, and perhaps enjoy as much, as those
	who travel in reality; but I fancy there are some of my young readers
	who would rather test the matter by their own experience, than by the
	inadequate descriptions which I have to offer them.</p>
	<p>Sicily, as is well known, is the largest island in the Mediterranean
	Sea. It was anciently called Trinacria, from its triangular shape, and
	is about six hundred miles in circumference. Each of its extremities
	is terminated by a promontory, one of which was called by the ancients
	Lilybeum, and faces Africa; another called Pachynus, faces the Peloponessus
	of Greece; and the third, Pelorum, now Capo di Boco, faces
	Italy. The aspect of the country is very mountainous: some of the
	mountains are lofty; but towering above all, like an enthroned spirit,
	rises Ætna. His giant form can be seen from elevated grounds in the
	most remote parts of the island, and the mariner can discern his snowy
	crown more than a hundred miles. But Sicily abounds in luxuriant
	plains and charming valleys, and its soil is proverbially rich: it once
	bore the appellation of the Granary of Rome; and it is now said that
	if properly tilled it would produce more grain than any country of its size
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page104" name="page104"></a>104</span>in the world. Its beauty and fertility were often celebrated by ancient
	bards, who described the sacred flocks and herds of Apollo on its delightful
	slopes. The plain of Enna, where Proserpine and her nymphs
	gathered flowers, was famous for delicious honey; and according to an
	ancient writer, hounds lost their scent when hunting, in consequence of
	the odoriferous flowers which perfumed the air; and this may be no
	fable; for in Spring, as I myself have seen, the flowers are abundant and
	fragrant beyond description; and it seemed to me that the gardens of
	Europe had been supplied with two-thirds of their choicest treasures
	from the wild stores of Sicily.</p>
	<p>The history of Sicily is as varied and interesting as the features of
	its surface; but of this I must give only such a brief and hurried sketch
	as, to those who are not conversant with it, will serve to render the scenes
	I intend to describe more intelligible and interesting than they otherwise
	would be. Its early history, then, like that of most nations of antiquity,
	is wrapped in obscurity. Poets feign that its original inhabitants were
	Cyclops; after them the Sicani, a people supposed to have been from
	Spain, were the possessors; then came the Siculi, a people of Italy. The
	enterprising Phœnicians, those early monarchs of the sea, whose ships
	had even visited the remote and barbarous shores of Britain, formed
	some settlements upon it; and in the eighth century before Christ
	various colonies of Greeks were planted on its shores, and became in
	time the sole possessors of the island. These Grecian founders of Syracuse,
	Gela, and Agrigentum, seduced from their own country by the
	love of enterprise, or driven by necessity or revolution from their homes,
	brought with them the refinement, religion, and love of the beautiful,
	that have distinguished their race above all others; and in a short time
	after their establishment in Sicily, the magnificence of their cities, the
	grandeur of their temples, equalled if they did not surpass those of their
	fatherland. About the year 480 before Christ, a fierce enemy landed on
	the coast of Sicily with two thousand gallies: this was the warlike Carthaginian,
	whose altars smoked with the sacrifice of human victims.
	This formidable invader was defeated under the great Gelon of Syracuse,
	who was called the father of his country; but the Carthaginians, returned
	again and with better fortune, at length became masters of the
	island. The Romans next conquered Sicily, and held it for several
	centuries. The Saracens in the ninth century were in the full tide of
	successful conquest. They landed first in the bay of Mazara, near
	Selinuntium, and after various conflicts and fortune, finally subjugated
	the whole island in the year 878. The crescent continued to glitter
	over the towers of Sicily for about three centuries, when the Normans,
	a band of adventurers whom the crusades of the Holy Sepulchre had
	brought from their northern homes, after a conflict of thirty years under
	Count Roger, expelled the Saracen in the year 1073, and planted the
	banner of the cross in every city of the land. Soon after that time it
	came under Spain and Austria; France and England have severally
	been its rulers. It is now under the crown of Naples.</p>
	<p>Such is a brief outline of the eventful history of Sicily; a land
	formed by nature in her fairest mould; but which the crimes and ambition
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page105" name="page105"></a>105</span>of men have desecrated by violence, oppression, and bloodshed;
	and with the substitution of a word, one might exclaim with the poet:</p>
	<div class="poem">
		<div class="stanza">
			<p class="i2">&#8216;<span class="special_name">Sicilia</span>! <span class="special_name">O Sicilia</span>! thou who hast</p>
			<p class="i2">The fatal gift of beauty, which became</p>
			<p class="i2">A funeral dower of present woes and past,</p>
			<p class="i2">On thy sweet brow is sorrow ploughed by shame,</p>
			<p class="i2">And annals graved in characters of flame.</p>
			<p class="i2">Oh <span class="special_name">God</span>! that thou wert in thy nakedness</p>
			<p class="i2">Less lovely or more powerful, and couldst claim</p>
			<p class="i2">Thy right, and awe the robbers back who press</p>
			<p>To shed thy blood, and drink the tears of thy distress!&#8217;</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<p>The aspect of Sicily is widely different from that of this country;
	its beauty is dependent on other forms and associations. <em>Here</em>, we have
	vast forests that stretch their shady folds in melancholy grandeur; the
	mountain tops themselves are clad in thick umbrage, which, rejoicing
	in the glory of the autumnal season, array themselves in rainbow dyes.
	<em>There</em>, no wide forests shade the land; but mountains more abrupt than
	ours, and bearing the scars of volcanic fire and earthquake on their
	brows, are yet clothed with flowers and odoriferous shrubs. The plains
	and slopes of the mountains are now but partially under cultivation;
	vineyards and olive-groves generally clothe the latter, while over the
	gentler undulating country, or the plains, fenceless fields stretch far
	away, a wilderness of waving grain, through which the traveller may
	ride for hours nor meet a human being, nor see a habitation, save when
	he lifts his eyes to some craggy steep or mountain pinnacle, where
	stands the clustered village. The villages and larger towns are generally
	set among groves of orange, almond, and pomegranate trees, with
	here and there a dark Carruba, or Leutisk tree, casting its ample shade.
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page106" name="page106"></a>106</span>Fields of the broad bean, the chief food of the laboring classes, serves
	at times to vary with vivid green the monotony of the landscape. The
	traveller rolls along over no Macadamised road in his comfortable carriage,
	but mounted on his mule, leaves him to choose his own track
	among the numerous ones that form what is called the <i>strada-maëstro</i>,
	or master-road, between city and city. Here and there he will come to
	a stone fountain, constructed perhaps centuries ago, which still furnishes
	a delightful beverage for himself and beast. Oftentimes the road leads
	through a country entirely waste, and covered with tall bunches of grass
	or the dwarfish palmetto; sometimes in the cultivated districts the road
	is bounded by the formidable prickly-pear, which grows to the height
	of twenty feet, or by rows of the stately aloe, and not unfrequently by
	wild hedges of myrtle, intertwined with innumerable climbing plants,
	whose flowers the traveller can pick as he rides along. Generally the
	road-side is perfectly enamelled with flowers of various hue and fragrance.
	No majestic river, like the Hudson, spreads before him, with
	all its glittering sails and swift steam-boats; but ever and anon the
	blue and placid Mediterranean bounds his vision, or indents the shore,
	with here and there a picturesque and lazy barque reflected in the waves.</p>
	<p>I have before said that the towns and villages are generally perched
	like eagles&#8217; nests in high places. This is particularly the case with
	those of the interior: many of them are inaccessible to carriages, except
	the <i>Letiga</i>, a sort of large sedan-chair, gaudily decorated with pictures
	of saints, and suspended between two mules, one of which trots before
	and the other behind, to the continual din of numerous bells and the
	harsh shouts of the muleteers. I never saw one of these vehicles,
	which are the only travelling carriages of the interior of Sicily, without
	thinking that there might be a <em>land-sickness</em> even worse than a sea-sickness;
	for the motion of the letiga in clambering up and down the
	broken steeps must be far more tempestuous than any thing ever experienced
	at sea. Between village and village you see no snug villa,
	farm-house, or cottage by the road-side, or nestling among the trees;
	but here and there a gloomy castellated building, a lonely ruin or stern
	Martello tower, whose dilapidated walls crown some steep headland,
	against whose base washes the ever-murmuring waves. Now the traveller
	descends to the beach, his only road; the mountains are far inland,
	or dip their broad bases in the sea-foam, or impend in fearful masses
	over his head. He ascends again, and journeys over wastes which
	undoubtedly in the time of the Greek and the Roman were covered
	with fruits and grain; but which now are treeless and desolate as the
	deep whose breezes stir the flowers that deck them. At times he must
	ford streams, which, if swollen with late rains, are perilous in the
	extreme.</p>
	<p>I remember once on my journey descending from one of those treeless
	wastes upon a spot very different from any thing on this side of the
	Atlantic. It was called Verdura, from its green and verdant character.
	A stream which flowed through a plain bounded by lofty mountains here
	fell into the sea. A large mill, which much resembles an ancient castle,
	and in all probability had served both purposes in times gone by, stood
	near. Upon the sandy beach close by, and hauled entirely out of the
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page107" name="page107"></a>107</span>water, lay several vessels in the style of Homer&#8217;s ships; and I have
	no doubt bore a strong resemblance to ships of ancient time, for they
	were picturesquely formed, and painted fantastically with figures of
	fishes and eyes. The wild-looking mariners were lounging lazily about
	in their shaggy capotes, or engaged in loading their vessels with grain,
	the product of the neighboring plains. Up the steep we had just descended
	a letiga was slowly winding; and on a green declivity overlooking
	the sea, a flock of goats were browsing, and their shepherd
	reclined near in listless idleness. Open and treeless as was this scene,
	there was such a peaceful character about it, such an air of primitive
	simplicity, that it made a strong impression on my mind.</p>

	<p>It does not come within the scope of this paper to offer any description
	of the larger cities of Sicily, Palermo, Messina, etc. Most readers
	have seen accounts of them more ample and more interesting than I
	could offer. Of the smaller places I must content myself with giving
	a very general description, so that I may retain the requisite space, in
	this division of my article, for some notice of an ascent which I made
	to the sublime summit of Mount Ætna.</p>
	<p>The secondary towns to which I have alluded, such as Calatifini,
	Sciacca, Caltagerone, etc., are in general picturesquely situated, and
	are built in a massive and sometimes even in a magnificent style. The
	churches and houses are all of hewn stone, and exhibit the various
	styles of architecture of the builders; the Saracenic, the Norman-Gothic,
	or the later Spanish taste. Sometimes the styles are fantastically
	intermixed; but the whole, to the architect, is extremely interesting.
	Flat roofs and projecting stone balconies from the upper windows
	are perhaps the most characteristic features of the houses. The
	churches, though large, are seldom beautiful specimens of architecture;
	and the interior is in general extremely ornate, and decorated with gaudy
	gilding and pictures, and images of <span class="special_name">Christ</span> and saints, disgustingly
	painted. The streets, wide or narrow, would appear to us somewhat
	gloomy and prison-like; and paint is a thing scarcely known on the
	exterior or perhaps interior of an ordinary house. The air of the interior
	of the common houses of the Sicilian towns is as gloomy and comfortless
	as can be imagined. A few wooden benches, a table firmly
	fixed in the stone pavement, a fire-place composed of a few blocks of
	stone placed on the floor, the smoke of which is allowed to make its
	escape as it best can at the window, which is always destitute of glass,
	and is closed by a rude wooden shutter when required; a bed consisting
	of a mattress of the same hue as the floor, raised a few feet from it
	by means of boards on a rude frame; some sheep-skins for blankets, and
	sheets of coarse stuff whose color serves as an effectual check on the
	curiosity of him who would pry too closely into its texture; are the
	chief articles of furniture to be found in the habitations of the Sicilian
	poor. Beside the human inhabitants of these uninviting abodes, there
	are innumerable lively creatures, whose names it were almost impolite
	to mention in polished ears; and I might not have alluded to them had
	they confined themselves to such places; but they rejoice in the palace
	as well as in the cottage, and to the traveller&#8217;s sorrow inflict themselves
	without his consent as travelling companions through the whole Sicilian
	tour.</p>
	<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page108" name="page108"></a>108</span>The houses of the more wealthy are spacious and airy, but not much
	superior in point of comfort. They are often of commanding exterior,
	and are called <i>palazzi</i>, or palaces. Of course, there are exceptions to
	this general character of discomfort; but judging from my own observation,
	they are few. On approaching a Sicilian village, the eye of the
	traveller will almost surely be attracted by a capacious and solid building,
	surmounted by a belfry-tower, and commanding the most charming
	prospect in the vicinity. It is surrounded with orange groves and
	cypress-trees, and looks like a place fitted for the enjoyment of a contemplative
	life. He will not long remain in doubt as to the purpose of the
	building whose site is so delightfully chosen; for walking slowly along
	the shady path, or seated in some pleasant nook, singly or in groups, he
	will perceive the long-robed monks, the reverend masters of the holy
	place.</p>

	<p>Connoisseurs say that a landscape is imperfect without figures; and as
	that is the case in a picture, it is most probably so in a magazine article;
	and the reader might complain if I were to neglect giving some
	slight outlines of the figures of the Sicilian landscape. In travelling
	from city to city, although they may not be more than twenty miles
	apart, the wayfarer meets with very few persons on the road; seldom an
	individual, and only now and then, at an interval of miles, a group of
	men mounted on mules, each person carrying a gun; or perhaps a convoy
	of loaded mules and asses with several muleteers, some mounted
	and some on foot, who urge by uncouth cries and blows the weary beasts
	over the rocky or swampy ground, or up some steep acclivity or across
	some torrent&#8217;s bed. At times he will see a shepherd or two watching
	their flocks; these are half-naked, wild looking beings, scarcely raised
	in the scale of intelligence above their bleating charge. Their dwelling
	may be hard by, a conical hut of grass or straw, or a ruined
	tower. On the fertile slopes or plains he will sometimes observe a
	dozen yokes of oxen ploughing abreast. The laborers probably chose
	this contiguity for the sake of company across the wide fields. If the
	grass or grain is to be cut, it is by both men and women armed with a
	rude sickle only. It is seldom you meet either man or woman on foot
	upon the roads; men scarcely ever. Donkeys are about as numerous
	as men, and their ludicrous bray salutes your ear wherever the human
	animal is to be seen.</p>

	<p>The peasant-women through a great part of Sicily wear a semi-circular
	piece of woollen cloth over their heads; it is always black or white,
	and hangs in agreeable folds over the neck and shoulders. There is but
	little beauty among them; and alas! how should there be? They are
	in general filthy; the hair of both old and young is allowed to fall in
	uncombed elf-locks about their heads; and the old women are often
	hideous and disgustful in the extreme. The heart bleeds for the women:
	they have more than their share of the labors of the field; they have
	all the toils of the men, added to the pains and cares of womanhood.
	They dig, they reap, they carry heavy burthens&#8212;burthens almost incredible.
	In the vicinity of Ætna I met a woman walking down the
	road knitting: on her head was a large mass of lava weighing at least
	thirty pounds, and on the top of this lay a small hammer. Being puzzled
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page109" name="page109"></a>109</span>to know why the woman carried such a piece of lava where lava
	was so abundant, I inquired &#8216;the wherefore&#8217; of Luigi, our guide. He
	answered that as she wished to knit, and not having pockets, she had
	taken that plan to carry the little hammer conveniently. That piece of
	stone, which would break our necks to carry, was evidently to her no
	more than a heavy hat would be to us. It may be thought that I draw
	a sorry picture of these poor Islanders; but I would have it understood
	that on the side of Messina, and some other parts, there is apparently a
	little more civilization; but they are an oppressed and degraded peasantry;
	ignorant, superstitious, filthy, and condemned to live on the coarsest
	food. They are as the beasts that perish, driven by necessity to sow that
	which they may not reap. How applicable are the words of <span class="special_name">Addison</span>:</p>

	<p>But the Sicilians are <em>naturally</em> a gay, light-hearted people, like the
	Greeks, their forefathers; and if the cloud which now rests upon them
	were removed, and we have reason to think it is lifting, they would be
	as bright and sunny as their own skies. The women of the better classes
	wear the black mantilla when they venture into the streets, which they
	seldom do, except to attend mass or the confessional. This robe is extremely
	elegant, as it is worn, but it requires an adept to adjust it gracefully.
	It covers the whole person from head to foot; in parts drawn
	closely to the form, in others falling in free folds. But for its color, I
	should admire it much: it seems such an incongruity for a young and
	beautiful female to be habited in what appear to be mourning robes. I
	was often reminded of those wicked lines of <span class="special_name">Byron</span>&#8217;s on the gondola:</p>
	<div class="poem">
		<div class="stanza">
			<p>&#8216;For sometimes they contain a deal of fun,</p>
			<p>Like mourning-coaches when the funeral&#8217;s done.&#8217;</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<p>But let us turn from the animate to the inanimate, and visit the famous
	Ætna, called by the Sicilians <i>Mongibello</i>. From the silence of Homer
	on the subject, it is supposed that in his remote age the fires of the mountain
	were unknown; but geologists have proof that they have a far
	more ancient date. The Grecian poet Pindar is the first who mentions
	its eruptions. He died four hundred and thirty-five years before <span class="special_name">Christ</span>;
	from that time to this, at irregular intervals, it has vomited forth its
	destructive lavas. It is computed to be eleven thousand feet high. Its
	base, more than an hundred miles in circumference, is interspersed
	with numerous conical hills, each of which is an extinct crater, whose
	sides, now shaded by the vine, the fig tree, and the habitations of man,
	once glowed with the fiery torrent. Some of them are yet almost destitute
	of vegetation; mere heaps of scoriæ and ashes; but the more
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page110" name="page110"></a>110</span>ancient ones are richly clad with verdure. Let the reader imagine a
	mountain whose base is as broad as the whole range of the Catskills,
	as seen from Catskill village, rising to nearly three times their height;
	its lower parts are of gentle ascent, but as it rises it becomes more
	and more steep, until it terminates in a broken summit. Imagine it
	divided, as the eye ascends, into three regions or belts: the first and
	lowest is covered with villages, gardens, vineyards, olive-groves, oranges,
	and fields of grain and flax, and the date-bearing palm. The second
	region, which commences about four thousand feet above the sea, is
	called the <i>Regione Sylvosa</i>, or woody region. Here chestnuts, hexes,
	and on the north pines of great size flourish. This belt reaches to the
	elevation of about seven thousand feet, where the <i>Regione Scoperta</i>, or
	bare region, commences. The lower part of this is intermingled lava,
	rocks, volcanic sands, and snow; still higher are vast fields of spotless
	snow, which centuries have seen unwasted, with here and there a ridgy
	crag of black lava, too steep for the snows to lodge upon; and toward
	the summit of the cone, dark patches of scoriæ and ashes, which, heated
	by the slumbering fires, defy the icy blasts of these upper realms of
	air. It will readily be supposed that, when viewed from a distance,
	Mount Ætna is an object to make a deep impression on the mind:</p>

	<p>On the ninth of May, myself and travelling companion commenced
	the ascent of Mount Ætna; and as the season was not the most favorable,
	the snows extending farther down the sides of the mountain than in
	summer, we were equipped, under the direction of our guide, with coarse
	woollen stockings to be drawn over the pantaloons, thick-soled shoes,
	and woollen caps. Mounting our mules, we left Catania in the morning.
	The road was good and of gradual ascent until we reached Nicolosi,
	about fourteen miles up the mountain. We saw little that was particularly
	interesting on our route except that the hamlets through which we
	passed bore fearful evidences of the effects of earthquake. Arrived at
	Nicolosi, the place where travellers usually procure guides and mules
	for the mountain, it was our intention to rest for the remainder of the
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page111" name="page111"></a>111</span>day; but Monte Rosso, an extinguished crater, being in the vicinity,
	my curiosity got the better of my intention to rest, and I sallied forth to
	examine it. The road lay through the village, which is built of the
	lava, and is arid and black, and many of the buildings rent and twisted.
	Monte Rosso was formed by the eruption of 1669, which threw out a torrent
	of lava that flowed thirteen miles, destroying a great part of the city
	of Catania in its resistless course to the sea, where it formed a rugged
	promontory which at this day appears as black, bare, and herbless as
	on the day when its fiery course was arrested by the boiling waters.
	And here I would remark, that the lavas of Ætna are very different
	from those of Vesuvius. The latter decompose in half a century, and
	become capable of cultivation; those of Ætna remain unchanged for
	centuries, as that of Monte Rosso testifies. It has now been exposed to
	the action of the weather nearly two hundred years, with the exception
	of the interstices where the dust and sand have collected, it is destitute
	of vegetation. Broken in cooling into masses of rough but sharp fracture,
	its aspect is horrid and forbidding, and it is exceedingly difficult to
	walk over. If two centuries have produced so little change, how <em>many</em>
	centuries must have served to form the rich soil which covers the greater
	part of the mountain&#8217;s sides and base!</p>
	<p>Our purpose was to see the sun rise from the summit of Ætna; and
	at nine in the evening, our mules and guides being ready, we put on
	our Sicilian capotes, and sallied forth. We had two guides, a muleteer,
	and as there was no moon, a man with a lantern to light the mules in
	their passage over the beds of lava. For several miles the way was
	uninteresting, it being too dark to see any thing except the horrid lava or
	sand beneath the feet of the mules. At times the road was so steep that
	we were ordered by our guides to lean forward on the necks of the mules,
	to keep them and ourselves from being thrown back. At length we entered
	the woody region. Here the path was less rocky; and as we
	wound up the mountain&#8217;s side, beneath the shadows of noble trees, I could
	not but feel the solemn quietness of a night on Ætna, and contrast it
	with what has been and what will in all probability be again, the intermitting
	roar of the neighboring volcano, and the dreadful thunder of
	the earthquake. At midnight we arrived at the <i>Casa delle Neve</i>, or
	House of Snow. This is a rude building of lava, with bare walls, entirely
	destitute of furniture. We made a fire on the ground, took
	some refreshments which we had brought with us, and in about an hour
	remounted our mules, and proceeded on our journey. We soon left
	the region of woods; and being now at an elevation of seven thousand
	feet above the sea, felt somewhat cold, and buttoned our capotes
	closer about us. From the ridges of lava along which we rode, by
	the light of the stars which now became brilliant, we could discern
	the snow stretching in long lines down the ravines on either hand; and
	as we advanced, approaching nearer and nearer, until at length it spread
	in broad fields before us. As the mules could go no farther, we dismounted,
	and taking an iron-pointed staff in our hands, we commenced
	the journey over the snows. It was now half-past one, and we had
	seven miles to traverse before reaching the summit. The first part of the
	ascent was discouraging, for it was steep, and the snow so slippery that
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page112" name="page112"></a>112</span>we sometimes fell on our faces; but it became rather less steep as we
	ascended, and though fatiguing, we got along comfortably. As the atmosphere
	was becoming rare, and the breathing hurried, we sat on the
	snow for a few minutes now and then. At such times we could not but
	be struck with the splendor of the stars, far beyond any thing I had
	ever seen. The milky way seemed suspended in the deep heavens, like
	a luminous cloud, with clear and definite outline. We next arrived at
	the <i>Casa degli Inglese</i>; so called, but alas for us! the ridge of the roof
	and a part of the gable were all that rose above the snow. In the
	midst of summer, travellers may make use of it; but to us it was unavailing,
	except the gable, which served in a measure to shield us from
	the icy wind which now swept over the mountain. We again partook
	of a little refreshment, by way of preparation for the most arduous part
	of our undertaking, and were now at the foot of the great cone. The
	ascent was toilsome in the extreme. Snow, melted beneath in many
	places by the heat of the mountain; sharp ridges of lava; loose sand,
	ashes, and cinders, into which last the foot sank at every step, made the
	ascent difficult as well as dangerous. The atmosphere was so rare that
	we had to stop every few yards to breathe. At such times we could hear
	our hearts beat within us like the strokes of a drum. But it was now
	light, and we reached the summit of the great cone just as the sun rose.</p>
	<p>It was a glorious sight which spread before our eyes! We took a
	hasty glance into the gloomy crater of the volcano and throwing ourselves
	on the warm ashes, gazed in wonder and astonishment. It would
	be vain for me to attempt a description of the scene. I scarcely knew
	the world in which I had lived. The hills and valleys over which we
	had been travelling for many days, were comprised within the compass
	of a momentary glance. Sicily lay at our feet, with all its &#8216;many
	folded&#8217; mountains, its plains, its promontories, and its bays; and round
	all, the sea stretched far and wide like a lower sky; the Lipari islands,
	Stromboli and its volcano, floating upon it like small dusky clouds; and
	the Calabrian coast visible, I should suppose, for two hundred miles,
	like a long horizontal bank of vapor! As the sun rose, the great
	pyramidal shadow of Ætna was cast across the island, and all beneath
	it rested in twilight-gloom. Turning from this wonderful scene, we
	looked down into the crater, on whose verge we lay. It was a fearful
	sight, apparently more than a thousand feet in depth, and a mile in
	breadth, with precipitous and in some places overhanging sides, which
	were varied with strange and discordant colors. The steeps were
	rent into deep chasms and gulfs, from which issued white sulphurous
	smoke, that rose and hung in fantastic wreaths about the horrid crags;
	thence springing over the edge of the crater, seemed to dissipate in the
	clear keen air. I was somewhat surprised to perceive several sheets of
	snow lying at the very bottom of the crater, a proof that the internal
	fires were in a deep slumber. The edge of the crater was a mere
	ridge of scoriæ and ashes, varying in height; and it required some care,
	in places, to avoid falling down the steep on one hand, or being precipitated
	into the gulf on the other. The air was keen; but fortunately
	there was little wind; and after spending about an hour on the summit,
	we commenced our descent.</p>
	<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page113" name="page113"></a>113</span>We varied our course from the one we took on ascending, and visited
	an altar erected to Jupiter by the ancients, now called the <i>Torre del
	Filosofo</i>. Soon after we came upon the verge of a vast crater, the
	period of whose activity is beyond the earliest records of history. <i>Val
	di Bove</i>, as it is called, is a tremendous scene. Imagine a basin several
	miles across, a thousand feet in depth at least, with craggy and perpendicular
	walls on every side; its bottom broken into deep ravines and
	chasms, and shattered pinnacles, as though the lava in its molten state
	had been shaken and tossed by an earthquake, and then suddenly congealed.
	It is into this ancient crater that the lava of the most recent
	eruption is descending. It is fortunate that it has taken that direction.</p>
	<p>In another and concluding number, the reader&#8217;s attention will be
	directed to the <i>Architectural Antiquities of Sicily</i>, especially those of
	Grecian structure, which will be described in the order in which they
	were visited.</p>

		<h2 class="title">A NIGHT ON THE PRAIRIE.</h2>

	<h3 class="byline">BY A BUFFALO HUNTER.</h3>

	<p><span class="first_word">While</span> looking over my &#8216;omnium gatherum;&#8217; the same being a
	drawer containing scraps of poetry, unfinished letters, half-written editorials,
	incidents of travel, obsolete briefs, with many other odds and
	ends that have fallen from my brain during the last three years, but which
	from want of quality in them or lack of energy in me, have failed to
	reach the dignity of types and ink; I came across a diary kept while
	hunting buffalo with the Sac and Fox Indians, some two hundred miles
	west of the Mississippi, during the summer of 1842. Finding myself
	interested in recurring to the incidents of that excursion, it occurred to
	me that matter might be drawn therefrom which would not be without interest
	to the public. I have therefore ventured to offer the following for
	publication; it being an account of a night passed at the source of the
	Checauque, when I did not deem my scalp worth five minute&#8217;s purchase,
	and when I cheerfully would have given ten years of an ordinary life
	to have been under the humblest roof in the most desolate spot in the
	&#8216;land of steady habits.&#8217;</p>

	<p>I have said that we were in the country of the Sioux. That our situation
	may be understood, I would remark farther, that between the latter
	and the confederated tribes of the Sac and Fox Indians, there has
	been for the last forty years, and still exists, the most inveterate hostility;
	the two parties never meeting without bloodshed. The Government
	of the United States, in pursuance of that policy which guides its conduct
	toward the various Indian tribes, for the preservation of peace between
	these two nations, have laid out between them a strip of country
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page115" name="page115"></a>115</span>forty miles in width, denominated the &#8216;Neutral Ground,&#8217; and on to which
	neither nation is permitted to extend their hunting excursions.</p>

	<p>On the occasion of which I write, the Sacs and Foxes, having been
	disappointed in finding buffalo within their own limits, and perhaps feeling
	quite as anxious to fall in with a band of Sioux as to obtain game,
	had passed the &#8216;Neutral Ground,&#8217; and were now several days&#8217; journey
	into the country of their enemies.</p>

	<p>For the last two days we had marched with the utmost circumspection;
	our spies ranged the country for miles in advance and on either
	flank, while at night we had sought some valley as a place of encampment,
	where our fires could not be seen from a distance. Each day we
	had perceived signs which indicated that small parties of Sioux had
	been quite recently over the very ground we were travelling. The
	whites in the company, numbering some eleven or twelve, had remonstrated
	with the Indians, representing to them that they were transgressing
	the orders of the government, and that should a hostile meeting take
	place they would certainly incur the displeasure of their &#8216;great father&#8217;
	at Washington.</p>

	<p>Heedless of our remonstrances they continued to advance until it became
	evident that the Sioux and not buffalo were their object. The truth
	was, they felt themselves in an excellent condition to meet their ancient
	enemy. They numbered, beside old men and the young and untried,
	three hundred and twenty-five warriors, mounted and armed with rifles,
	many of them veterans who had seen service on the side of Great
	Britain in her last war with this country, and most of whom had served
	with Black Hawk in his brief but desperate contest with the United
	States. Moreover, they placed some reliance on the whites who accompanied
	them; all of whom, except my friend <span class="keep_together">B&#8212;&#8212;</span>, of Kentucky, one
	or two others and myself, were old frontier men, versed in the arts of
	Indian warfare.</p>

	<p>As for myself, I felt far from comfortable in the position in which I
	found myself placed; hundreds of miles from any white settlement,
	and expecting hourly to be forced into a conflict where no glory was to
	be gained, and in which defeat would be certain death, while victory
	could not fail to bring upon us the censure of our government. The
	idea of offering up my scalp as a trophy to Sioux valor, and leaving my
	bones to bleach on the wide prairie, with no prayer over my remains
	nor stone to mark the spot of my sepulture, was far from comfortable.
	I thought of the old church-yard amidst the green hills of New-England,
	where repose the dust of my ancestors, and would much preferred
	to have been gathered there, full of years, &#8216;like a shock of corn fully
	ripe in its season,&#8217; rather than to be cut down in the morning of life by the
	roving Sioux, and my frame left a dainty morsel for the skulking wolf
	of the prairie. I communicated my sentiments to <span class="keep_together">B&#8212;&#8212;</span>, and found
	that his views corresponded with mine. &#8216;But,&#8217; said he, with the spirit
	of a genuine Kentuckian, &#8216;we are in for it, Harry, and we must fight;
	it will not do to let these Indians see us show the white feather.&#8217;</p>

	<p>It was under such circumstances, and with these feelings, that we
	pitched our tents after a hard day&#8217;s march, in a valley near the margin
	of a little stream which uniting with others forms the Checauque, one
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page116" name="page116"></a>116</span>of the tributaries of the Mississippi. The river flowed in our front. In
	our rear, and surrounding us on either side, forming a sort of amphitheatre,
	was a range of low hills crowned with a grove of young hickorys.
	A branch on our left, running down to the stream, separated our
	tents from the encampment of our Indian allies. Our camp consisted
	of three tents pitched some fifteen steps apart. <span class="keep_together">B&#8212;&#8212;</span> and myself occupied
	the middle one. We had a companion, a scrub of a fellow, who
	forced himself upon us as we were on the point of starting, and whom
	we could not well shake off. To this genius, on account of his many
	disagreeable qualities, we had given the soubriquet of &#8216;<i>Common Doings</i>.&#8217;
	The other whites of the party occupied the other two tents.</p>

	<p>We had just finished the usual routine of camp duty for the night,
	&#8216;spansered&#8217; our horses, eaten our suppers, laid in a supply of fuel for
	our fires, and were sitting around them smoking our pipes and listening
	to the marvellous tales of an old &#8216;Leatherstocking&#8217; of the party, whose
	life had been passed between the Rocky Mountains and the Mississippi,
	when two of our Indian spies came in, passing in front of our tents and
	across the branch to the Indian camp. One of our party followed them
	to hear their report, and soon returned with the information that the
	spies had seen an encampment of Sioux, and that the Sacs and Foxes
	were then holding a council as to what measures it was best to pursue.
	Others of our party, who understood the Indian tongue, went across for
	farther information. Mean time we remained in great anxiety, canvassing
	among ourselves the probable truth of the report, and speculating on
	the course most proper for us to take. Our friends soon returned,
	having heard the full report of the spies as it was delivered before the
	chiefs in council. They had proceeded some eight miles beyond the
	place of our encampment to a hill in the vicinity of Swan Lake; from
	the hill they had seen a large body of Sioux, numbering as near as they
	could estimate them, five or six hundred. From the manner in which
	they were encamped and from other signs, they knew them to be a &#8216;war
	party;&#8217; and having made these observations, they withdrew, concealing
	themselves as much as possible, and as they supposed, without being
	discovered. The effect of this information upon us may easily be imagined.
	We were &#8216;in for it&#8217; sure enough! We had expected for several
	days that we should meet the enemy, but to find them so near us in
	such force, so far outnumbering our own, we had not anticipated.</p>

	<p>The question now was, what were we to do? Some proposed that we
	should move our camp across the branch and pitch our tent among our
	Indian allies; for it was argued with much force that if our spies had
	been discovered, the Sioux would follow their trail, and as it passed
	directly by our tents, we should fall the first victims; that if the Sioux,
	notwithstanding their superiority in numbers, should not think it prudent
	to attack the main camp, they would not fail to attack, according to
	their custom, the out-camps, take what scalps they could, and retreat.
	But there was a strong objection to moving our camp: the Indians frequently
	during the march had desired us to pitch our tents among them,
	but we had always declined, preferring to be by ourselves. What would
	they say if we should now break up our encampment and go among
	them? &#8216;White men are cowards! They rejected our request when all
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page117" name="page117"></a>117</span>was safe, but now at the approach of danger they come skulking among
	us like dogs for protection.&#8217;  No; we could not do this; pride forbade
	it. We next discussed the expediency of dividing ourselves into a
	watch, and keeping guard by turns through the night. The more experienced
	of the party, and particularly Jamison, an old hunter and Indian
	fighter, said that this would only exhaust us, and would be of no avail;
	that our Indian allies had spies around the encampment in every direction;
	that if they failed to perceive the approach of the enemy, we could
	not discover them; that the first intimation our sentinels would have
	would be an arrow through the body; that our best plan would be to
	extinguish our fires, prepare our arms, lie down with them in our hands,
	rely on the Indian spies for notice of the enemy&#8217;s approach, and on the
	first alarm make our way to the Indian camp, being careful as we approached
	it to give the pass-word for the night, &#8216;<i>Wal-las-ki-push-eto</i>.&#8217;
	We all finally came to this conclusion.</p>

	<p>During the discussion, two of the party had not spoken a word; one
	was our tent-mate &#8216;Doings,&#8217; who was so completely paralyzed with
	fright as to be unable to think or speak; the other was old &#8216;Leatherstocking,&#8217;
	who listened with the utmost coolness to all that was said,
	occasionally expressing assent or dissent by a nod or shake of the head.
	I now observed him quietly examine his rifle, draw the charge and reload;
	take out the flint and replace it with a new one; he then threw
	himself down for the night, his bared knife in his left hand, and his
	right resting on the breech of his rifle, remarking as he composed himself
	to sleep, &#8216;We must be ready boys; there&#8217;s no telling when the varmints
	will be upon us.&#8217;</p>

	<p><span class="keep_together">B&#8212;&#8212;</span> and myself prepared our arms: each of us wore a brace of
	pistols in a belt; these were carefully loaded and buckled on; our rifles
	were next examined and put in order; our hatchets were placed at hand,
	and with many misgivings we laid ourselves down. It was some time
	before I could sleep, and when I did, my repose was disturbed by
	dreams. How long I slept I am unable to say, perhaps not more than
	an hour, when I was suddenly awakened. I listened. The noise of the
	horses, of which there were several hundred grazing in the valley, with
	the tinkling of the bells on their necks, were the only sounds that at first
	met my ear; all else was silent. Presently I heard a noise as if made
	by the stealthy tread of a man; then a voice, or perhaps the cry of
	some animal. It was repeated. I heard it in the grove, on the hill, then
	an answering cry on the other side of the stream. I knew that Indians
	in a night-attack make signals by imitating the cry of some animal; and
	the sounds I heard, though like those made by wild beasts, seemed to
	me to be in reality human voices. I drew a pistol from my belt, cocked
	it, and with a hatchet in my other hand, crept out of the tent, and lying
	on the ground, looked cautiously around. The cries continued at
	intervals, and I became more and more satisfied that they were human
	voices. I felt, I <em>knew</em> that the Sioux were about to attack us. A
	thousand thoughts flashed across my mind. I thought of the home of
	my childhood, my far distant kindred; a mother, sisters, brothers.
	Unskilled as I was in Indian warfare, I expected to be slain. I was
	alarmed; frightened perhaps, but not paralyzed. I resolved to fight
	to the last, and if I <em>must</em> die, to fill no coward&#8217;s grave.</p>

	<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page118" name="page118"></a>118</span>As my eyes became more accustomed to the darkness, I began to distinguish
	objects; and peering beyond our line of tents, I saw on our
	right, between me and the grove, three dark objects like human heads
	projecting out of the grass. While I was observing them, two of them
	disappeared, and I could discern the grass wave as they made their way
	toward our encampment. There was no longer room for doubt. I
	called to <span class="keep_together">B&#8212;&#8212;</span> in a whisper; he was on his feet and by my side in an
	instant, a cocked pistol in each hand. I directed his attention to what
	I saw. He looked steadfastly for a moment, then raising his eyes to the
	grove, exclaimed in a whisper, &#8216;The timber is full of Indians! I see them
	advancing from tree to tree; it is time for action. I shall fall, but you
	may be saved; if so, let my friends in Kentucky know that I died like
	a brave man. I will arouse the rest.&#8217;</p>

	<p>He went to the tent on our left, while I remained watching the
	approach of the enemy. I could see them distinctly as they moved
	from tree to tree. I heard <span class="keep_together">B&#8212;&#8212;</span> call in a whisper, &#8216;Jamison! Jamison!&#8217;
	Jamison came out of his tent but without his arms. <span class="keep_together">B&#8212;&#8212;</span> told
	him of our danger, and directed his attention to the Indians in the grove.
	As he spoke Jamison stretched out his arms and gave a yawn, remarking,
	&#8216;These Injuns are mighty unsartin critters; there&#8217;s no knowing
	about their motions;&#8217; crawled into his tent again. <span class="keep_together">B&#8212;&#8212;</span> returned;
	neither of us spoke. We lay down and drew our blankets over us; at
	length <span class="keep_together">B&#8212;&#8212;</span> said:</p>

	<p>&#8216;Harry?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;What?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Hoaxed! by thunder!&#8217;</p>

	<p>The whole truth, which had been breaking in upon my mind by
	degrees, now flashed upon me, and I raised a shout of laughter. At
	this instant, poor &#8216;Doings,&#8217; who had been awake from the commencement,
	but who was so scared that he had rolled himself under the eaves
	of the tent, and contracted himself into a space scarcely larger than my
	arm, and who in his terror would have lain still and had his throat cut
	without wagging a finger in defence; this poor, miserable &#8216;Doings&#8217; exclaimed
	&#8216;Haw! haw! haw! I knew it all the time; I never see fellows
	so scared!&#8217; This was too bad. However, we had our laugh out, discussed
	plans for vengeance, went to sleep and had quiet slumbers for
	the rest of the night.</p>

	<p>The next morning we ascertained that the whole story about the Sioux
	encampment had been fabricated for the purpose of trying our mettle,
	and that all save <span class="keep_together">B&#8212;&#8212;</span>, myself and &#8216;Doings,&#8217; were in the secret. The
	moving objects which I had seen in the grass were Indian dogs prowling
	around for food, and the Indians in the timber existed only in our
	excited imaginations.</p>

	<p class="post_break">I may hereafter give an account of the <i>modus operandi</i> of our revenge,
	and of our mode of hunting the buffalo, in which we met with much
	success; and of other matters of interest which fell under my observation
	during the sixty days we spent with this tribe of Indians.</p>

	<h2 class="title">THE QUOD CORRESPONDENCE.</h2>

	<h3 class="subtitle fancy">HARRY HARSON.</h3>

	<h4 class="chapter_title">CHAPTER TWENTY-FIRST.</h4>


	<p><span class="first_word">In</span> the same room from which Craig and Jones had set out on their
	ill-fated errand, and at the hour of noon on the following day, the latter
	was crouching in front of the fire-place, which had been so bright and
	cheery the night before, but which now contained nothing except ashes,
	and a few half-burned stumps, charred and blackened, but entirely extinguished.
	Over these Jones bent, occasionally shivering slightly, and
	holding his hands to them, apparently unconscious that they emitted no
	heat, and then dabbling in the ashes, and muttering to himself. But a
	few hours had elapsed since he had left that room a bold, daring, desperate
	man; yet in that short time a frightful change had come over him.
	His eyes were blood-red; his lips swollen and bloody, and the under
	one deeply gashed, as if he had bitten it through; his cheeks haggard
	and hollow, his hair dishevelled, his dress torn, and almost dragged from
	his person. But it was not in the outward man alone that this alteration
	had taken place. In spirit, as well as in frame, he was crushed. His
	former iron bearing was gone; no energy, no strength left. He seemed
	but a wreck, shattered and beaten down&#8212;down to the very dust. At
	times he mumbled to himself, and moaned like one in suffering.  Then
	again he rose and paced the room with long strides, dashing his hand
	against his forehead, and uttering execrations. The next moment he
	staggered to his seat, buried his face in his hands, and sobbed like a
	child.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Tim,&#8217; said he, in a low broken voice, &#8216;poor old Tim; I killed you,
	I know I did; but blast ye! I loved you, Tim. But it&#8217;s of no use,
	now; you&#8217;re dead, and can never know how much poor Bill Jones cared
	for you. No, no; you never can, Tim. We were boys together, and
	now I&#8217;m alone; no one left&#8212;no one, <em>no</em> one!&#8217;</p>

	<p>In the very phrenzy of grief, that succeeded these words, he flung
	himself upon the floor, dashing his head and hands against it, and rolling
	and writhing like one in mortal pain. This outbreak of passion was
	followed by a kind of stupor; and crawling to his seat, he remained
	there, like one stunned and bereft of strength. Stolid, scarcely breathing,
	and but for the twitching of his fingers, motionless as stone; with his
	eyes fixed on the blank wall, he sat as silent as one dead; but with a
	heart on fire, burning with a remorse never to be quenched; with a
	soul hurrying and darting to and fro in its mortal tenement, to escape
	the lashings of conscience. Struggle on! struggle on! There is no
	escape, until that strong heart is eaten away by a disease for which
	there is no cure; until that iron frame, worn down by suffering, has
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page121" name="page121"></a>121</span>become food for the worm, and that spirit and its persecutor stand before
	their final judge, in the relations of criminal and accuser.</p>

	<p>A heavy step announced that some one was ascending the stairs.
	Jones moved not. A loud knock at the door followed. Still he did not
	stir. The door was then flung open, in no very gentle manner, for it
	struck the wall behind it with a noise that made the room echo: but a
	cannon might have been fired there, and Jones would not have heard it.</p>

	<p>The person however who had thus unceremoniously opened the way
	to his entrance, seemed perfectly indifferent whether his proceedings
	were agreeable or otherwise. His first movement on entering the room
	was to shut the door after him and lock it; his next was to look about
	it to see whether it contained any other than the person of Jones.
	Having satisfied himself on that score, he walked rapidly up to him
	and tapped him on the shoulder.</p>

	<p>Jones looked listlessly up at him, and then turning away, dabbled in
	the ashes, without uttering a word.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Hello! Bill Jones,&#8217; said the stranger, after waiting a moment or two
	in evident surprise, &#8216;what ails you?&#8217;</p>

	<p>The man made no reply.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Are you sulky?&#8217; demanded the other; &#8216;Well, follow your own humor;
	but answer me one question: where&#8217;s Craig?&#8217;</p>

	<p>Jones shuddered; and his hand shook violently. Rising up, half
	tottering, he turned and stood face to face with his visiter.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Good day to ye, Mr. Grosket,&#8217; said he, with a ghastly smile, and
	extending his hand to him. &#8216;Good day to ye. It&#8217;s a bright day, on
	the heels of such a night as the last was.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Good God! what ails you, man?&#8217; exclaimed Grosket, recoiling before
	the wild figure which confronted him; and then taking his hand,
	he said: &#8216;Your hand is hot as fire, your eyes blood-shot, and your face
	covered with blood. What have you been at? What ails you?&#8217;</p>

	<p>Jones passed his hand feebly across his forehead, and then replied:
	&#8216;I&#8217;m sick at heart!&#8217;</p>

	<p>He turned from Grosket, and again crouched upon the hearth, mumbling
	over his last words, &#8216;Sick at heart! sick at heart!&#8217;&#8212;nor did he
	appear to recollect Grosket&#8217;s question respecting Craig. If he did, he
	did not answer it, but with his arms locked over his knees, he rocked
	to and fro, like one in great pain.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Are you ill, man, or are you drunk?&#8217; demanded Grosket, pressing
	heavily on his shoulder. &#8216;Speak out, I say: what ails you? If you
	don&#8217;t find your tongue, I&#8217;ll find it for you.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Jones, thus addressed, made an effort to rally, and partially succeeded;
	for after a moment he suddenly rose up erect, and in a clear, bold voice,
	replied:</p>

	<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m not drunk, Mr. Grosket, but I <em>am</em> ill; God knows what&#8217;s the
	matter with me. Look at me!&#8217; he continued, stepping to where the
	light was strongest; &#8216;Look at me well. Wouldn&#8217;t you think I&#8217;d been
	on my back for months?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;You look ill enough;&#8217; was the blunt reply.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Well, then, what do you want?&#8217; demanded Jones, in a peevish tone;
	&#8216;why do you trouble me? I can&#8217;t bear it. Go away; go away.&#8217;</p>

	<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page122" name="page122"></a>122</span>&#8216;I will, when you&#8217;ve answered my question. Where&#8217;s Craig?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t know. He was here last night; but he went out, and hasn&#8217;t
	been here since.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Where did he go?&#8217;</p>

	<p>Jones shook his head: &#8216;He didn&#8217;t say.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Was he alone?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; replied the other, evidently wincing under these questions;
	&#8216;No; there was a man with him, nigh about my size. He went with
	him. That&#8217;s all I know about either of them. There, there; get
	through with your questions. They turn my head,&#8217; said he, in an
	irritable tone.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Why did he take a stranger?&#8217; demanded Grosket, without paying
	the least attention to his manner. &#8216;You forget that I know you and he
	generally hunt in couples.&#8217;</p>

	<p>It might have been the cold of the room striking through to his very
	bones that had so powerful an effect on Jones, but he shook from head
	to foot, as he answered:</p>

	<p>&#8216;Look at me! God! would you have a man out in such a night as
	that was, when he&#8217;s almost ready for his winding-sheet?&#8217;</p>

	<p>Grosket&#8217;s only reply was to ask another question.</p>

	<p>&#8216;What was the name of the man who went with him?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t know.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;What did they go to do?&#8217;</p>

	<p>Jones hesitated, as if in doubt what answer to make, and then, as if
	adopting an open course, he said: &#8216;I&#8217;ve know&#8217;d you a good while, Mr.
	Grosket, and you won&#8217;t blab, if I tell you what I suspect, will ye? It&#8217;s
	only guess-work, after all. Promise me that; I know your word is
	good.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Grosket paused a moment before he made the promise; and then
	said: &#8216;Well, I&#8217;ll keep what you tell me to myself. Now then.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;It was a house-breaking business,&#8217; said Jones, sinking his voice.
	&#8216;They took pistols with them; and I heard Tim tell the other one to
	take the crow-bar and the glim. That&#8217;s all I know. I was too much
	down to listen. There; go away now. I&#8217;ve talked till my head is
	almost split. Talking drives me mad. Go away.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Grosket stood perfectly still in deep thought. The story might be
	true; for the city was ringing with the news of the burglary, and of the
	death of one of the burglars by the hands of his comrade. It was
	rumored too, that the dead man had been identified by some of the officers
	of the police, and that his name was Craig. It was this, taken in
	connection with the facts that the attempt had been made on Harson&#8217;s
	house; that an effort had been made to carry off a child who lived with
	him, and of its being known to Grosket that Rust had often employed
	these two men in matters requiring great energy and few scruples, that
	had induced him thus early to visit their haunt, to ascertain the truth of
	his suspicions; and to endeavor, if possible, to ferret out the plans of
	their employer. The replies of Jones, short and abrupt as they were,
	convinced him that his suspicions respecting Craig were correct; but
	who could the other man be?</p>

	<p>Engrossed with his own thoughts, he appeared to forget where he was
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page123" name="page123"></a>123</span>and who was present; for he commenced walking up and down the
	room; then stopped; folded his arms, and talked to himself in low, broken
	sentences. Again he walked to the far end of the room and stopped
	there.</p>

	<p>Jones, in the mean time, to avoid farther questioning, seated himself;
	and leaning his elbows on his knees, hid his face in his hand. He was
	disturbed, however, by feeling himself shaken roughly by the shoulder.
	&#8216;What you&#8217;ve just been telling me, is a lie!&#8217; said Grosket, sternly.
	&#8216;You should know me well enough not to run the risk of trifling with me.
	I want the truth and nothing else. Where were <em>you</em> last night?&#8217;</p>

	<p>Jones looked up at him and then answered in a sullen tone: &#8216;I&#8217;ve
	told you once; I was here.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Grosket went to a dark corner of the room and brought back Jones&#8217;
	great-coat, completely saturated with water. &#8216;This room scarcely leaks
	enough to do that,&#8217; said he, throwing it on the floor in front of Jones.
	&#8216;Ha! what&#8217;s that in the pocket?&#8217;</p>

	<p>He thrust in his hand and drew out a pistol. The hammer was down,
	the cap exploded, and the inside of the muzzle blackened by burnt
	powder.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Fired off!&#8217; said he. &#8216;You told the truth. The man who went with
	Craig <em>did</em> look like you. I know the rest. Tim Craig is dead, and you
	shot him.&#8217;</p>

	<p>An expression of strange meaning crossed the face of the burglar as
	he returned the steady look of his visiter without making any reply.
	But Grosket was not yet done with him; for he said in a slow, savage
	tone: &#8216;Now mark me well. If you lie in what you tell me, I&#8217;ll hang
	you. Who employed you to do this job?&#8217;</p>

	<p>Jones eyed him for a moment, and then turned away impatiently and
	said, &#8216;I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about. Don&#8217;t worry me.
	I&#8217;m sick and half crazy. Get away, will ye!&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;<em>This</em> to me! to <em>me!</em>&#8217; exclaimed the other, stepping back, his eyes
	flashing fire; &#8216;you forget yourself.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Jones rose up, his red hair hanging like ropes about his face, and his
	bloodshot eyes and disfigured features giving him the look rather of a wild
	beast than of a man. Shaking his finger at Grosket, he said, &#8216;Keep
	away from me to day, I say. There&#8217;s an evil spell over me. Come
	to-morrow, but don&#8217;t push me to-day, or God knows what you may drive
	me to do. There, there&#8212;go.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Still Grosket stirred not, but with a curling lip and an eye as bright
	as his own, and voice so fearfully quiet and yet stern that at another time
	it might have quelled even the strong spirit of the robber, he said
	&#8216;Enoch Grosket never goes until his object is attained.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Then you won&#8217;t go?&#8217; demanded Jones.</p>

	<p>&#8216;No!&#8217;</p>

	<p>Jones made a hasty step toward him, with his teeth set and his eyes
	burning like coals of fire; but whatever may have been his purpose,
	and from the expression of his face, there was little doubt but that it was
	a hostile one, he was diverted from it by hearing a hand on the latch of
	the door and a voice from without demanding admittance.</p>

	<p>&#8216;It is Rust,&#8217; exclaimed Grosket, in a sharp whisper. He touched the
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page124" name="page124"></a>124</span>burglar on the shoulder and said in the same tone, &#8216;I&#8217;m going in <em>there</em>.&#8217;
	He pointed to a closet in a dark part of the room, nearly concealed by
	the wainscotting.  Let him in, and betray me if you dare!&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;You seem to know our holes well,&#8217; muttered Jones. &#8216;You&#8217;ve been
	here afore.&#8217; Grosket made no reply, but hurried across the room and
	secreted himself in the closet, which evidently had been constructed as
	a place of concealment, either for the tenants of the room themselves, or
	for whatever else it might not suit their fancy to have too closely examined.</p>

	<p>Jones stared after him, apparently forgetting the applicant for admission,
	until a renewed and very violent knocking recalled his attention to
	it. He then went to the door, drew back the bolt, and walked to
	his seat, without even glancing to see who came in, or whom the person
	was who followed so closely at his heels. Nor did he look around until
	he felt his arm roughly grasped, and a sharp stern voice hissing in
	his ear:</p>

	<p>&#8216;So, so! a fine night&#8217;s work you&#8217;ve made of it. Tim Craig is dead
	and the whole city is already ringing with the news; and <em>you</em>, you&#8217;re
	a murderer!&#8217;</p>

	<p>Jones started from his seat with the sudden spasmodic bound of one
	who has received a mortal thrust. He stared wildly at the sharp thin
	face which had almost touched his, and then sat down and said:</p>

	<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t talk to me so, Mr. Rust; I can&#8217;t bear it.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Ho, ho! your conscience is tender, is it? It has a raw spot that won&#8217;t
	bear handling, has it? We&#8217;ll see to that. But to business,&#8217; said
	he, his face becoming white with rage; his black eyes blazing, and his
	voice losing its smoothness and quivering as he spoke.</p>

	<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ve come here to fulfil my agreement; you were to get that child
	for me to-day; I&#8217;ve come for her; where is she?&#8217;</p>

	<p>Jones looked at him with an expression of impatience mingled with
	contempt, but made him no answer.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Tim Craig was to have gone to that house; he was to have carried
	her off; he was to have her here, <em>here</em>, <span class="small_all_caps">HERE</span>!&#8217; said he, in the same fierce
	tone. &#8216;Why hasn&#8217;t he done it?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Because he&#8217;s dead,&#8217; said Jones savagely.</p>

	<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m glad of it! I&#8217;m glad of it!&#8217; exclaimed Rust. &#8216;He deserved it.
	The coward! <em>Let</em> him die.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Tim Craig was no coward,&#8217; replied Jones, in a tone which, had Rust
	been less excited, would have warned him to desist.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Ha!&#8217; exclaimed Rust, scanning him from head to foot, as if surprised
	at his daring to contradict him, &#8216;Would you gainsay me?&#8217;</p>

	<p>Jones returned his look without flinching, his teeth firmly set and grating
	together. At last he said:</p>

	<p>&#8216;I <em>do</em> gainsay you; and I <em>do</em> say, whoever calls Tim Craig a coward
	lies!&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;<em>This</em>, and from <em>you</em>!&#8217; exclaimed Rust, shaking his thin finger in his
	very face; &#8216;<em>this</em> from you; <em>you</em>, a house-breaker, a thief, and last night
	the murderer of your comrade. Ho! ho! it makes me laugh! Fool!
	How many lives have you? One word of mine could hang you.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;<em>You&#8217;ll</em> never hang <em>me</em>,&#8217; replied Jones, in the same low, savage tone.
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page125" name="page125"></a>125</span>&#8216;I wish you had, before that cursed job of yours made me put a bullet
	in poor Tim. I wish you had; but it is too late. You wont <em>now</em>.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Words cannot describe the fury of Michael Rust at seeing himself
	thus bearded by one whom he had been used to see truckle to him, whom
	he considered the mere tool of Craig, and whom he had never thought
	it worth while even to consult in their previous interviews.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Wont I? <em>wont</em> I? Look to yourself,&#8217; muttered he, shaking his finger
	at him with a slow, cautioning gesture, &#8216;Look to yourself.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;You&#8217;re right, I <em>will</em>; I say I <em>will</em>,&#8217; exclaimed Jones, leaping up and
	confronting him. &#8216;I say I <em>will</em>; and now I do!&#8217; He grasped him by
	the throat and shook him as if he had been a child.</p>

	<p>&#8216;I might as well kill him at once,&#8217; muttered he, without heeding the
	struggles of Rust. &#8216;It&#8217;s <em>him</em> or <em>me</em>; yes, yes, I&#8217;ll do it.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Coming to this fatal conclusion, he flung Rust back on the floor and
	leaped upon him. At this moment, however, the door of the closet was
	thrown open, and Grosket, whom he had entirely forgotten, sprang suddenly
	out:</p>

	<p>&#8216;Come, come, this wont do!&#8217; said he; &#8216;no murder!&#8217;</p>

	<p>Jones made no effort to resist the jerk at his arm with which Grosket
	accompanied his words, but quietly rose, and said:</p>

	<p>&#8216;Well, he drove me to it. He may thank <em>you</em> for his life, not <em>me</em>.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Relieved from his antagonist, Rust recovered his feet, and turning to
	Grosket said, in a sneering tone:</p>

	<p>&#8216;Michael Rust thanks Enoch for having used his influence with his
	friend, to prevent the commission of a crime which might have made both
	Enoch and his crony familiar with a gallows. A select circle of
	acquaintance friend Enoch has.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Grosket, quietly, pointed to the closet and said:</p>

	<p>&#8216;You forget that I have been there ever since you came in the room;
	and have overheard every thing that passed between you and <em>my</em> friend.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Rust bit his lip.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t let it annoy you,&#8217; continued he, &#8216;for the most of what I heard
	I knew before. I have had my eye on you from the time we parted.
	With all your benevolent schemes respecting myself I am perfectly
	familiar. The debt which you bought up to arrest me on; your attempt
	to have me indicted on a false charge of felony; the quiet hint dropped
	in another quarter, that if I should be found with my throat cut, or a
	bullet in my head, you wouldn&#8217;t break your heart; I knew them all;
	but I did not avail myself of the law. Shall I tell you why, Michael
	Rust? Because I had a revenge sweeter than the law could give.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Friend Enoch is welcome to it when he gets it,&#8217; replied Rust, in a
	soft tone. &#8216;But the day when it will come is far off.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;The day is at hand,&#8217; replied Grosket. &#8216;It is here: it is now. Not
	for a mine of gold would I forego what I now know; not for any thing
	that is dear in the world&#8217;s eyes, would I spare you one pang that I can
	now inflict.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Rust smiled incredulously, but made no reply.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Your schemes are frustrated,&#8217; continued Grosket. &#8216;The children
	are both found; their parentage known; <em>your</em> name blasted. The brother
	who fostered you, and loaded you with kindness will have his eyes
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page126" name="page126"></a>126</span>opened to your true character; and you will be a felon, amenable to
	the penalty of the law, whenever any man shall think fit to call it down
	upon your head. But this is nothing to what is in store for you.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Well,&#8217; said Rust, with the same quiet smile; &#8216;please to enumerate
	what other little kindnesses you have in store for me.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;I will,&#8217; replied Grosket. &#8216;<em>I</em> was once a happy man. I had a wife
	and daughter, whom I loved. My wife is dead; what became of my
	child? I say,&#8217; exclaimed he bitterly, &#8216;what became of my child?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Young women will forget themselves sometimes,&#8217; said Rust, his thin
	lip curling. &#8216;She became a harlot&#8212;only a harlot.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Grosket grew deadly pale, and his voice became less clear, as he
	answered:</p>

	<p>&#8216;You&#8217;re right&#8212;you&#8217;re right! why shrink from the word. It&#8217;s a
	harsh one; but it&#8217;s God&#8217;s truth; she <em>did</em>&#8212;and she died.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s frank,&#8217; said Rust, &#8216;quite frank. I am a straight-forward
	man, and always speak the truth. I&#8217;m glad to see that friend Enoch
	can bear it like a Christian.&#8217;</p>

	<p>A loud, taunting laugh broke from Grosket; and then he said:</p>

	<p>&#8216;Thus much for <em>me</em>; now for yourself, Michael Rust. <em>You</em> once
	had a wife.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Rust&#8217;s calm sneer disappeared in an instant, and he seemed absolutely
	to wither before the keen flashing eye which was fixed steadfastly
	on his.</p>

	<p>&#8216;She lived with you two years; and then she became&#8212;shall I tell
	you what?&#8217;</p>

	<p>Rust&#8217;s lips moved, but no sound came from them. Grosket bent his
	lips to his ear, and whispered in it. Rust neither moved nor spoke.
	He seemed paralyzed.</p>

	<p>&#8216;But she died,&#8217; continued Grosket, &#8216;and she left a child&#8212;a daughter;
	<em>mine</em> was a daughter too.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Rust started from a state of actual torpor; every energy, every
	faculty, every feeling leaping into life.</p>

	<p>&#8216;That daughter is now alive,&#8217; continued Grosket, speaking slowly,
	that every word might tell with tenfold force. &#8216;That daughter now is,
	what you drove my child to be, a harlot.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s false as hell!&#8217; shouted Rust, in a tone that made the room ring.
	&#8216;It&#8217;s false!&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s true. I can prove it; prove it, clear as the noon-day,&#8217; returned
	Grosket, with a loud, exulting laugh.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Oh! Enoch! oh, Enoch!&#8217; said Rust, in a broken, supplicating tone,
	&#8216;tell me that it&#8217;s false, and I&#8217;ll bless you! Crush me, blight me, do
	what you will, only tell me that my own loved child is pure from spot
	or stain! Tell me so, I beseech you; <em>I</em>, Michael Rust, who never
	begged a boon before&#8212;<em>I</em> beseech you.&#8217;</p>

	<p>He fell on his knees in front of Grosket, and clasping his hands together,
	raised them toward him.</p>

	<p>&#8216;I cannot,&#8217; replied Grosket, coldly, &#8216;for it&#8217;s as true as there is a
	heaven above us!&#8217;</p>

	<p>Rust made an effort to speak; his fingers worked convulsively, and
	he fell prostrate on the floor.</p>

	well, oh! my friend!&#8217; exclaimed the dying youth; and as he grasped
	my hand his lips moved tremblingly, tears gushed upon his wan cheeks,
	and an expression of very sadness stole upon him. His looks were
	lingering; such as one flings back upon some paradise of beauty which
	he leaves forever; some home which childhood has endeared to him, and
	affection has filled with the loves and graces. Pity touched my soul as
	I regarded silently that beaming countenance, alas! so shrunken from
	the swelling, undulating lines of his hilarious health; a pity such as
	one feels whose hopes are too inexplicably bound up with another&#8217;s, who
	shares his very being, and who knows by all the sympathies of a brother&#8217;s
	bosom that the other&#8217;s heart-strings are snapping. <i>Animæ dimidium
	meæ!</i>&#8212;beautiful expression of the poet, comprehended less while life
	unites, than when death severs. It is only when gazing on the seal
	which has been set, we inquire &#8216;Where is the spirit?&#8217; and struggle in
	vain to understand that great difference; when the smiles which shed
	their sunshine have rapidly vanished, and the voice we loved has died
	away like the music of a harp; when that which was light, joy, wit,
	eloquence, has departed with the latest breath; when, in short, we are
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page129" name="page129"></a>129</span>awakened from our revery by the clods falling on the coffin, and the
	mourners moving away; it is then that the soul, diminished of its
	essence, flits away with a strange sense to its unjoyous abode, as a bird
	would return to its lonely nest.</p>

	<p>There never existed one who more lived and moved, and had his
	spiritual being in the affections; a sensitive nature wooed into life by the
	kindness of the faintest breath, but killingly crushed by the footsteps of
	the thoughtless or the cruel. For such a one, life is well deserving of
	the epithet applied to it by the poet Virgil: <i>dulcis vita</i>, sweet life. It is
	not a vulgar sensuality, a Lethean torpor; the triumph of the grosser
	nature over the eternal principle within. It is already a separation of
	the carnal from the spiritual; a refinement of fierce passions; a present
	divorce from a close and clinging alliance; a foretaste of the waters of
	life; in short, the very essence and devotion of a pure religion. Would
	it seem strangely inconsistent that a being of so sweet a character as I
	shall describe him, my poor young friend declared, with a gush of the
	bitterest tears, that he <em>could</em> not go into the dark valley, for he loved life
	with an inconceivable, passionate love? His was the very agony and
	pathos of the dying Hoffman, when almost with his latest breath, he alluded
	to &#8216;the sweet habitude of being.&#8217; But it was only, thanks be to
	<span class="special_name">God</span>! a short defection, a momentary clouding of that bright faith which
	was destined soon to see beyond the vale. His tears ceased to flow,
	glistened a moment, and then passed away as if they had been wiped
	by some gentle hand.</p>

	<p>He leaned upon a soft couch, so very pale and haggard that his hour
	seemed very near. Costly books strewed his table; pictures and many
	exquisite things were scattered about with lavish hand; for wealth administered
	to refined luxury, and affection crowned him with blessings which
	gold can never buy. A mother hid from him her bitter tears, and spoke
	the words of cheerfulness; sisters pressed around him with the poignant
	grief an only brother can inspire; a beautiful betrothed betokened
	to him in irrepressible tears her depth and purity of love. Letters came
	to him hurried on the wings of friendship, and impressed on all their
	seals with sentiments which awakened hope. Youth and beauty hovered
	around him with their unintermitted care, and Age sent up its fervent
	prayers to heaven. Oh! who but the ungrateful would not love a life
	so filled with blandishments and crowned with blessings? Who could
	see all these receding without a sigh, or feel the pressure of that kiss of
	love as pure as if it had its origin in Heaven? But with the finest
	organization of intellectual mind, he had been accustomed to look at all
	things in the light of poetry. For one so constituted the pleasures which
	are in store are as inexhaustible as the works or mercies of his God.
	Not an hour which did not present some new phase of undiscovered
	beauty. He revelled in the beams of the morning; the rising sun was
	never a common object, nor its grandeur ever lost upon a soul so conscious
	of the sublime. For all beauty in nature he found a correspondent
	passion in the soul; and intoxicated alike with the music of birds
	or the perfume of flowers, found no weariness in a life whose current
	was like the living spring, pure, perennial and delightful.</p>

	<p>To be so susceptible of pleasure, I would be willing to encounter all
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page130" name="page130"></a>130</span>the keenness of pangs suffered by such natures. For such, the rational
	delights of a year are crowded into a day, an hour; and the ignorant
	reader of their obituary sighs mournfully, computing their lives by a
	false reckoning. Yet after all, we have been disposed to regard the
	death of the young as something unnatural; the violent rending asunder
	of soul and body; the penalty enacted of a life artificial in its modes
	and repugnant to nature. As Cicero has beautifully expressed it, it is
	like the sudden quenching of a bright flame; but the death of the virtuous
	Old is as expected, as free from terror as the sunset; it is the
	coming of a gentle sleep after a long and weary day.</p>

	<p>Travers was in the very gush and spring-tide of his youth; yet
	crowned as he was with blessings, and every attribute for their most
	perfect enjoyment, the true secret of his too fond desire to live, was that
	<em>he loved</em>:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<div class="stanza">
			<p class="i12">&#8216;He loved but one,</p>
			<p>And that loved one, alas! could ne&#8217;er be his.&#8217;</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>In her the poetry of his life centred; and as a river is swollen by divers
	rills, and tributary streams, so all the thoughts and passions of his soul
	hurried with a pure and rapid tide to mingle and be lost in one. But
	illness, and the long looking at death, and above all, the Christian&#8217;s
	hope, enable us one by one to break off the dearest ties, and to renounce
	whatever we most love on earth. And so my young friend in good time
	emerged from the cloud which obscured his prospects, and saw clearly
	beyond the vale. It is not long since, being well assured that his fate
	was inevitable, he expressed a desire, which he carried into execution,
	to visit once more his well-loved haunts, and take a solemn farewell of
	them all. As one grasps the hand of a friend at parting, he looked his
	last at things which were inanimate. He rambled in the deep, dark
	groves whither he had so often gone in health, to enjoy their Gothic
	grandeur, to breathe the spirit of the religion they inspire, or to murmur
	in their deepest shades the accents of his pure and passionate love.
	He inscribed his name for the last time upon the smooth bark of a tree;
	then leaving them forever, as he emerged into the gay meadows, he
	turned to me with tears and said:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<div class="stanza">
			<p>&#8216;Ye woods, and wilds, whose melancholy gloom</p>
			<p>Accords with my soul&#8217;s sadness, and draws forth</p>
			<p>The voice of sorrow from my bursting heart!&#8217;</p>
		</div>
	</div>


	<p>He clambered the steep hill-side, and sinking exhausted beneath a
	smitten tree, enjoyed the picturesqueness of the scene; the meadows,
	the streams, the pasture-grounds, the dappled herds, the sereneness of
	the summer skies, cleft by the wing of the musical lark, in all their
	purity of blue. He sat beside the sea-shore, and watched the big billows
	breaking and bursting at his feet; and as he looked where the
	waters and the sky met together in the far horizon, he exclaimed, &#8216;Now
	indeed do I long to fly away!&#8217; Then he returned to his pillow, never
	to go forth again. &#8216;I shall die,&#8217; he said, &#8216;when the season is in its
	prime and glory; when the fields are green and the trees leafy; and the
	sunlight shall shimmer down through the branches where the birds sing
	over my grave.&#8217; Then casting a look at his books, where they stood
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page131" name="page131"></a>131</span>neatly arranged on the well-filled shelves, he lamented that he had not
	time to garner half the stores of a beautiful literature; to satisfy his
	perpetual thirst; to drink to the full at the &#8216;pure wells of English undefiled.&#8217;
	There were the Greek poets, whom he would have more intimately
	cherished, (he had been lately absorbed in the sublimity of the
	&#8216;Prometheus Vinctus;&#8217;) there was the great master and anatomizer of
	the human heart, who knew how to detail the springs of action common
	to all ages, the paragon of that deep learning which is not derived from
	books, but gleaned by his genius from all nature with a rare intuition,
	and with an incomprehensible power of research. In him what mines
	of instruction, what sources of undiscovered delight, what philosophy
	yet to be grappled with, to be laid to the heart! Charles Lamb has with
	a quaint melancholy depicted the pain of parting from his books, and
	from the indefinable delights laid up in each dear folio. Yet after all,
	what is the literature of one age but the reproduction, the remoulding,
	the condensation of the literature of another; the loss and destruction
	of its waste ore, but the re-setting of its gems, and the renewed investiture
	of all its beauties. There is no glowing thought, no exquisite
	conception, no sublime and beautiful idea, which is not imperishable as
	the mind itself, and which shall not be carried on from age to age, or
	if destroyed or lost upon the written page, revived by some happy coincidence
	of intellectual being, and perpetuated and enjoyed, here or
	hereafter, wherever mind exists. A communion like this will be a
	communion of spirits. A finer organization, expanded faculties shall
	rapidly consume the past; but oh, the future! what glories are to be
	crowded into its immensity? How shall knowledge be commensurate
	with the stars, or wander over the universe? Now bring me the written
	Revelation, the written word. It clasps within its volume all excellencies,
	all sublimities of speech; secrets which could not be developed
	by reason, nor found in the arcana of human wisdom. Henceforth
	this shall be my only companion, and its promises shall light my passage
	over the grave.&#8217;</p>

	<p>I marked the lustrous beaming of his eye, and from that time he
	looked at all things on the &#8216;bright side.&#8217; His very love could think
	upon its object without a tear, and look forward to a pure and eternal
	re-union. At last the hour of dissolution came. I knew it by its unerring
	symptoms; yet still I listened to his passionate, poetic converse.
	It was for the last time; I was in the chamber of death. What observer
	can mistake it; the darkened windows, the stillness, the grouping,
	the subdued sobs, the awful watchfulness for the identical moment when
	a lovely and intellectual spirit breaks its bonds, as if the strained vision
	could detect the spiritual essence. What a heart-sickness comes over
	those who love! What a change in the appearance of all things! The
	very sun-light is disagreeable, the very skies a mockery; the very
	roses unlovely. We look out of the casement, and see the external face
	of nature still the same; how heartless, how destitute of sympathy,
	now appears the whole world without, with the home, that inner world!
	How can those birds sing so sweetly on the branches; how can the
	flowers bloom as brightly as ever; how can those children play so
	gleefully; how can yon group laugh with such unconcern! He is an
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page132" name="page132"></a>132</span>only son. Though wan, and wasted in all his lineaments, his pure
	brow, his gentle expression, tell that he was worthy to be loved. Can
	no human power restore him to the arms of a fond mother? It is in vain!
	The spirit flutters upon his lips; it has departed. But it has left behind
	it a token; a clear, bright impress; a smile of undissembled love and
	purity; an expression beaming with the last unutterable peace; the
	graces which were so winning upon earth, but which shall attain their
	perfection in heaven.</p>

	<h2 class="title">A WINTER TRIP TO TRENTON FALLS.</h2>

	<h3 class="subtitle">IN THREE SCENES.</h3>

	<h4 class="chapter_title">SCENE FIRST.</h4>

	<p><span class="first_word">Morning</span>; eight on the clock. <span class="special_name">Billing&#8217;s Hotel</span>, Trenton. Outside,
	a clear bright sun glancing down through an atmosphere sparkling with
	frost, upon as fine a road for a sleigh-ride as ever tempted green-mountain
	boys and girls for a moonlight flit. Inside, a well-furnished breakfast-table,
	beef-steak, coffee, toast, etc., etc. On the one side of it your
	correspondent; serious, as if he considered breakfast a thing to be attended
	to. He is somewhat, as the lady on the other side of the table
	says, <em>somewhat</em> in the &#8216;sear leaf,&#8217; by which name indeed she is pleased
	to call him; but there is enough of spring in her, to suffice for all deficiencies
	in him. Like the morning, she is a <em>little</em> icy, but sunshiny,
	sparkling, exhilarating, thoughtful, youthful&#8212;and decided. She takes
	no marked interest in the breakfast.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Sear leaf!&#8217; Madam, say on.</p>

	<p>&#8216;I wish to go to the Falls.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;To what!&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;To the Falls&#8212;to Trenton Falls.&#8217;</p>

	<p>He drops his knife and fork. &#8216;Whew! what! in winter?&#8212;in the
	snow?&#8212;on the ice?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Certainly; that is just the season.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Crazy! You were there in the <span class="keep_together">summer&#8212;&#8212;&#8217;</span></p>

	<p>&#8216;I know it; every one goes there in summer. I must see them
	now. There&#8217;s no time like it; in their drapery of snow and ice; in
	the sternness and solitude, the wild grandeur of winter!&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;How you run on! You&#8217;ll miss the cars at Utica.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t care.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;You&#8217;ll be a day later in New-York.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t care. I must see them in their hoary head.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;You wish to see if they look as well in gray hairs as I do, perhaps.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;You really must go?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;You are a very imperious young lady; and allow me to say, that
	although some young <span class="keep_together">gentlemen&#8212;&#8212;&#8217;</span></p>

	<p>Lady, interrupting him: &#8216;Shall I ring the bell?&#8217; She rings it. Enter
	landlord. She orders the horse and cutter.</p>

	<h4 class="chapter_title">SCENE SECOND.</h4>

	<p>Enter landlord: &#8216;All ready, Sir.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Will you allow me to ask if your feet are warmly clad, Madam?&#8217;</p>

	<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page134" name="page134"></a>134</span>&#8216;I am ready for the ascent of Mont Blanc, or a ramble with a hunter
	upon the shore of Hudson&#8217;s Bay.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Very well; now for the cutter.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Landlord, just step round, if you please, and put that buffalo-robe a
	little more closely about the lady. Hold fast, hostler! That horse
	likes any thing better than standing still.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Ay, ay, Sir.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Now we are ready. Let go! Away we dash; &#8216;on for the Falls!&#8217;
	Gently, my good horse, gently round this corner; now &#8216;go ahead!&#8217;
	How do you like my steed, Madam?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;A rein-deer could not transact this little business better.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Is not this a glorious morning?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Vivifying to the utmost! How far we fail of becoming acquainted
	with the face of nature, when we only come to look upon it in summer!
	It is as if one should only look upon the human face in the hues of
	youth, and never upon the gray head; on the brow where high thoughts
	have left their impress; on the face which deeper and sterner knowledge,
	research, patience, have made eloquent, while stealing away the
	rose. As for me, though I am but a girl, I like to see sometimes an old
	man; one who in the trial-hour of life has kept his integrity; and when
	the snows of age fall on him, he gently bends beneath their weight, like
	those old cedars yonder by the way-side, beneath their weight of snow.
	Wherever the eye can pierce their white vesture, all is still deep spring-green
	beneath; unchanged at heart&#8212;strong and true. So I like to
	look on you, Sere Leaf.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Thank you! You have a gift at compliments.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Summer reminds one of feeling and Lalla Rookh; Winter; of intellect
	and Paradise Lost.&#8217;</p>


	<p>&#8216;How your voice rings in this clear air! Do you know what Dean
	Swift says a sleigh-ride is like? &#8216;Sitting in the draft of a door with
	your feet in a pail of cold water!&#8217;&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Abominable! libellous! Exhilaration and comfort are so blended
	in me <span class="keep_together">that&#8212;&#8212;</span> But is not that the house?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Ay; here we are! Smoke from the chimney; some one is there
	to welcome us, no doubt. Gently, my Bucephalus, through this gate!
	There comes the landlord. Treat my horse well, if you please; we
	are going to the Falls.&#8217;</p>


	<h4 class="chapter_title">SCENE THIRD.</h4>


	<p>&#8216;Madam, are you ready for the woods?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Quite. How still the air is! Why don&#8217;t you thank me for insisting
	on coming? You have no gratitude. There&#8217;s not two inches of
	snow on the ground. It all seems piled upon these grand old trees.
	There! see that tuft of it falling and now spreading into a cloud of
	spangles in the sun-light which streams down by those old pines. Hark!
	the roar of waters! The sound seems to find new echoes in these
	snow-laden boughs, and lingers as if loth to depart.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;This way, Madam; the trees are bent too low over the path to allow
	a passage there. We are near the bank which overlooks the first fall.
	Take my arm; the brink may be icy. Lo! the abyss!&#8217;</p>

	<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page135" name="page135"></a>135</span>&#8216;Magnificent! What a rush of waters! How the swollen stream
	foams and rages!&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;And see! the pathway under the shelving rock where we passed
	in summer is completely colonnaded by a row of tall ice pillars; gigantic,
	symmetrical&#8212;fluted, even. What Corinthian shaft ever equalled them!
	What capital ever rivalled the delicacy or grace of those ice-and-hemlock
	wreaths about their summits!&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;And see those pines, rank above rank, higher and higher; stately
	and still and snow-robed like tall centinels! Perhaps, Sear Leaf, the
	Old Guard might have stood thus in the Russian snows over <span class="special_name">Napoleon</span>,
	when he bivouacked on the hill-side, and sought rest while his spirit
	was as wildly tossed as the waters that dash beneath us.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Yes, Lady; or it may be that these trees in their perpetual green,
	in their calmness and dignity, may be emblematic of the way in which
	the angels who watch on earth look down on man. Perfect rest on perfect
	unrest.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Ah! you grow gloomy.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Took I not my hue from you? On, then, for the higher fall!&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;These trees seem to have increased in stature since the summer we
	were here. As we proceed, the snow lies thicker on them, and the
	branches seem closer locked; the roof overhead more complete. How
	still the woods are! Our very foot-fall is noiseless.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Influenced by the scene, they pass on in silence along the path which
	leads round the foot of the cone-like hill toward the cottage by the higher
	Falls, whose deep roar now breaks upon the ear, and rolls through the
	motionless forest. Thus then the Lady to Sear Leaf:</p>

	<p>&#8216;Has <span class="special_name">God</span> any other temple like this?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Never a one, reared by any hand save His!&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;What organ ever rolled so deep a bass through arches so grand!
	See how the sunlight glances amid the gnarled branches of the roof, and
	here and there falls through on the floor below; making those low icy
	forms look like the shrubs of the valley of diamonds in the eastern
	story. Just so it is that the light of truth struggles through entangled
	and dark mazes of human error, and here and there illuminate some
	humble mind with its pure ray; while others, tall and strong and
	haughty, like those old trees, are left darkened.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;You have a noble nature, and should be nobly mated. But here we
	are upon the brow of the hill which leads to the cottage. The snow is
	deeper here: gently, now; a slide down this bank might check even
	<em>your</em> enthusiasm. Take my arm; there&#8212;so; safe at the bottom! Let
	us go forward upon the platform of the cottage over the Falls. No
	bench? Well, sit upon my cloak.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;No, I won&#8217;t.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;You must. There; be <em>pleased</em> to sit and rest. What a gorgeous
	display of frost-work and flashing light on fantastic forms of ice! How
	the spray rises and waves and changes its hues in the sun! And the
	trees, how delicately each sprig of the evergreens is covered with a
	dress so white and shining &#8216;as no fuller on earth could whiten them.&#8217;&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Even so, Sear Leaf; And I love to think that the same one who
	wove the glorious dress to which you refer, to gladden Peter, made this
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page136" name="page136"></a>136</span>dazzling drapery, and gave us eyes to look upon it. It recalls to my
	mind the song of the Seraphim: &#8216;The whole earth is full of thy glory!&#8217;&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Did they not, Lady, sing of a moral glory?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;No; decidedly no. There was no moral glory in the earth when
	they sang that song. Even the chosen people of <span class="special_name">God</span> are then and
	there denounced as having abandoned Him. No; it was the glory of
	the works of His hands, such as we look upon this day, which elicited
	their praise.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;I believe your exegesis is right. The scene is glorious. Summer
	in all her loveliness has no dress like this. She has no hues equal to
	the play of colors on these walls and columns of ice, extending far as
	the eye can reach down the ravine, and towering in more than colossal
	grandeur. The water is in treble volume, and force and voice; and
	as it rolls its white folds of spotless foam down the valley, it reminds
	one of the great white throne of the Revelations, and this wavy foam the
	folds of the robe that filled the temple.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;It is inexpressibly, oppressively beautiful, Sear Leaf!&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Speaking of Revelation, how accurate is the description in Manfred
	of this scene!&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Let me hear it:&#8217;</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<div class="stanza">
	<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">It</span> is not noon; the sun-bow&#8217;s rays still arch</p>
	<p>The torrent with the many hues of heaven,</p>
	<p>And roll the sheeted silver&#8217;s waving column</p>
	<p>O&#8217;er the crags headlong perpendicular,</p>
	<p>And fling its lines of foaming light along</p>
	<p>And to and fro, like the pale courser&#8217;s tail,</p>
	<p>The giant steed to be bestrode by Death,</p>
	<p>As told in the apocalypse.&#8217;</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>&#8216;Well, Madam, why are you silent? Shall we go?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;No. I could stay here till nightfall. I was thinking of the lines
	succeeding those you have repeated:</p>


	<div class="poem">
		<div class="stanza">
		<p class="i12">&#8212;&#8212;&#8216;No eyes</p>
		<p>But mine now drink the sight of loveliness,&#8217;&#8217;</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>&#8216;Am I nobody?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;We are alone here. How many of the light of heart, in youth and
	strength and beauty, climbed these rocks, shouted in these old woods,
	and gathered the summer flowers along these banks&#8212;and passed away!
	Where are they now! Some who wrote their names in the traveller&#8217;s
	book in this cottage, have them now written by others on their tombstone.
	One I knew well, who, full of health and beauty, passed up this
	wild ravine, who has faded like the flowers she culled, and is now in her
	father&#8217;s house, to pass in a few more days to heaven. And of all the
	rest, did we know their history, what a picture would it give of life!&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;You are thoughtful for one so young.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Are not twenty years enough to make one a moment thoughtful?
	Tell me now, thou of the gray head, of what art <em>thou</em> thinking?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Of earth&#8217;s fairest scene, blent with her fairest daughter.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Bravo! For what fair lady on your native mountains did you frame
	that compliment twenty years ago?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Madam!&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;Well?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;It is time to return.&#8217;</p>

	<h2 class="title">CORONATION OF GEORGE THE FOURTH.</h2>

	<h3 class="byline">BY THE LATE WILLIAM ABBOTT.</h3>

	<p><span class="first_word">There</span> is one great and peculiar characteristic in all the movements
	of <span class="special_name">John Bull</span>. A more gullible epitome of the human race does not
	exist. Let the case be right or wrong, only apply to him an inflammatory
	preparation, through the medium of a little exaggerated truth, and
	his frame is prepared to receive the largest dose of monstrous improbabilities
	that can possibly be administered; and till he has had his &#8216;full
	swing&#8217; in the expression of his outraged feelings and boiling indignation,
	you might as easily attempt to check the mighty torrent of Niagara.
	John, however, is a free agent, and on the truest principles of freedom
	will hear but one side of the question as long as his prejudices continue;
	and after all, I believe it may fairly be put down to an honest impulse
	in favor of the oppressed, and a determination that no man, however
	elevated in rank, shall be screened from that equal justice which England
	delights in according. But the scales of justice, though equally
	balanced in the courts, get so bruised and bespattered in the minds of
	the fickle multitude, that time alone will bring them to their proper
	equilibrium. Let us travel back to the impeachment of the <span class="special_name">Duke of
	York</span>, in the case of the celebrated <span class="special_name">Mrs. Clark</span>. To attempt to palliate
	the acts of His Royal Highness was to commit an overt act of treason
	against the sovereign people; to admit his indiscretions, but deny his
	guilty participation, or even knowledge of the peculations committed in
	his name, would expose one to the reputation of being either a fool or a
	madman. The sage counsellors of the city, those bright constellations
	immortalized in all ages, not only set the noble example of awarding
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page139" name="page139"></a>139</span>the freedom of the city to the immortal Colonel Wardle for his
	wholesale calumnies, but services of plate poured in from all parts; and
	even a portion of the legislators of Great Britain were offering up their
	humble adoration at the shrine of an accomplished courtezan. What
	was the result? Reflection gradually triumphed; all the gross and
	filthy exaggerations were sifted through the dirty channels which had
	given rise to them; a sober judgment at length was given; and the
	Duke, though not freed from the responsibility of having been betrayed
	into great errors, was honorably and universally acquitted of all intentional
	wrong. From that moment a more popular prince was not in
	existence; and with the exception of those human infirmities &#8216;which flesh
	is heir to,&#8217; few men descended to the grave more really beloved. The
	chief of the gang of persecutors, Colonel Wardle, shrunk into miserable
	retirement, and died &#8216;unwept, unhonored, and unsung.&#8217;</p>


	<p>This, however, was nothing when compared with the mighty fever of
	excitement produced in the public mind by the arrival of <span class="special_name">Queen Caroline</span>
	in England. Here was political diet to satisfy the cravings of all
	parties; a stepping-stone to popularity in which all ranks participated.
	The peer, the lawyer, the church-warden, down to the very skimmings
	of the parish; sober rational people; the class so honorably prized in
	England, the middle class, also became enthusiasts in the cause of the
	&#8216;most virtuous Queen that ever graced these realms.&#8217; The independent
	voters of Westminster; the illustrious class of donkey-drivers; the retailers
	of cats&#8217;-meat; all, all felt a noble indignation at the treatment of
	&#8216;<span class="special_name">Keveen Caroline</span>.&#8217; Days that if allotted to labor would have increased
	the comforts of their homes and families, were freely sacrificed to
	processions in honor of Her Majesty. Addresses poured in from every
	parish in the vast metropolis; representatives of virtuous females were
	hired, all dressed in white&#8212;sweet emblem of their purity! Perhaps
	England was never nearer the brink of engulphing ruin. The high
	Tory aristocracy almost stood alone at this momentous period. The
	public sentiment took but one tone at the theatres; and &#8216;<span class="special_name">God</span> save the
	<span class="special_name">Queen</span>&#8217; was continually called for. At Covent-Garden and Drury-Lane
	an occasional struggle was made against the popular cry, but it
	was speedily drowned in clamor. The trial commenced, and an unfortunate
	witness appeared on behalf of the crown, who obtained the universal
	cognomen of &#8216;<i>Non mi Ricordo</i>.&#8217; This added fuel to the fire; and
	the irritation of the public mind was roused into phrenzy by the impression
	that perjured witnesses were suborned from foreign countries to
	immolate the Queen upon the altar of vengeance. If the Queen&#8217;s
	counsel had been satisfied with allowing the evidence for the prosecution
	to remain uncontradicted, and suffered the case to stand upon its
	own merits, Her Majesty must have been acquitted; but &#8216;by your own
	lips I will condemn you&#8217; was made too manifest in the defence. The
	division left so small a majority, that ministers wisely abandoned any
	farther prosecution of the case. I heard most of the speeches of the
	defence; and it was curious to observe the different modes of argument
	adopted. <span class="special_name">Brougham</span> was an advocate, pleading eagerly a doubtful
	cause; <span class="special_name">Denman</span> was the enthusiastic defender of a Queen conscious of
	her innocence, and setting all personal considerations at defiance. The
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page140" name="page140"></a>140</span>public feeling, no longer fed by an opposing power, calmly settled down,
	and men began to wonder at the cause of their phrenzy. The innocence
	of the Queen did not appear so manifest, as the unwise and heartless
	treatment she experienced. &#8216;A widowed wife, a childless mother;&#8217;
	these were powerful enough to excite the deepest sympathy; and certainly
	a much harder lot could not have befallen the humblest of her sex. Theatres
	are very commonly the touchstones by which one may discover the
	bearing of the public mind; and Her Majesty, by way of proving it,
	visited all the minor theatres, which were densely crowded upon each
	attendance. A play was then commanded at the two Theatres Royal.
	The effect produced at Drury-Lane I do not recollect; but it is certain
	that the announcement at Covent-Garden reduced rather than increased
	the receipts. The pit was but moderately attended, and the boxes nearly
	deserted. This was a touchstone from which there was no escaping;
	and it was really a mortifying scene to witness the utter neglect with
	which majesty was received. But alas! the bitter cup of mortification
	was to be drained to the very dregs; and the Queen&#8217;s own rashness, or
	the bad advice of wrong-headed counsellors, hastened the catastrophe.</p>


	<p>A short period had elapsed, when the public attention was gradually
	directed toward <span class="special_name">the Coronation</span>. The court papers teemed with descriptions
	of the expected magnificence. The length of time that had
	intervened between the coronation of George III. and the intended
	pageant of George IV., excited all the feeling of novelty. The known
	magnificence of the King, his undisputed taste, and his gallant, princely
	bearing, all kept attention on the <i>qui vive</i>. The unfortunate Queen, who
	obstinately rejected all compromise, remained in the country; and like
	an ignis fatuus, disturbed the serenity of men&#8217;s minds, and kept alive a
	feeling of anxiety. Mr. Harris, the manager and one of the proprietors
	of Covent-Garden, was gifted with a tact always ready to take advantage
	of scenes of passing interest. He lost no time in reviving the
	second part of Henry IV., with all the splendor of the coronation. The
	champion on this occasion excited much more interest than all the beauties
	of <span class="special_name">Shakspeare</span>, and the theatre was nightly crowded to suffocation.
	The whole company of performers paraded in the procession; and though
	a member of the peerage, I cannot exactly call to mind the title I bore;
	which, however, with my accustomed good fortune, I exchanged for a
	real character at the real coronation. Having the honor of being known
	most particularly to the Earl of Glengall, he with the greatest kindness
	made me his page upon that memorable occasion. This certainly was
	a very distinguished mark of his friendship, for only one Esquire was
	allotted to each peer, and the greatest interest was made to obtain those
	appointments.</p>


	<p>The eventful morning came; and London presented at day-break
	crowds of carriages of every description, and its floating population
	pouring in dense masses to every point that possessed the slightest degree
	of interest. Lord Glengall, in order to avoid the misery of passing
	through crowded streets, and of being every moment impeded in his
	course, engaged apartments in Lambeth, at Godfrey and Jule&#8217;s, the
	boat-builders, where he slept the night preceding. His lordship had
	appointed me to breakfast with him there, at six o&#8217;clock on that eventful
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page141" name="page141"></a>141</span>morning; I was resolved to be in time, and at half past two, <span class="small_all_caps">A. M.</span>, I
	left my home and fell in with a line of carriages on my way toward
	Westminster bridge. I found that many of them had been there from
	twelve the preceding night; peers and peeresses in their robes, gently
	moving, not hastening, to the desired spot. After waiting some two
	hours with exemplary patience, and finding my case entirely hopeless,
	I wisely took the precaution of driving to the water-side at Chelsea, for
	the purpose of procuring a boat. As it is possible that some of the distinguished
	artists of the day may wish to convey my appearance to posterity,
	I will give a description of my dress; and I shall also feel greatly
	obliged, if at the same time they will select the best-looking portrait of
	me for the likeness: a scarlet tunic, embroidered with gold-thread; a
	purple satin sash, with a deep gold fringe; a ruff <i>à la Elizabeth</i>; white
	satin pantaloons; shoes with crimson rosettes; black velvet hat and
	feathers. My hair, not naturally curling, had been put in graceful
	<i>papillote</i> the preceding evening. As I write in the reign of Queen
	<span class="special_name">Victoria</span>, the reader will readily believe that people are not much in
	the habit of walking about the streets in such a costume. Imagine
	therefore my arrival at the watermen&#8217;s landing very soon after five
	o&#8217;clock in the morning; a splendid sun pouring, if not absolutely a flood
	of light, yet its lovely beams upon my person. Crowds of little girls and
	boys instantly gathered on the spot, receiving me with small voices but
	loud huzzahs, as I descended from the carriage. A boat was immediately
	ordered; but as there were several at the landing, all but the
	one engaged naturally felt the cruelty of not being permitted to come
	in for their share of extortion on such an occasion.</p>

	<p>&#8216;I say, Sir,&#8217; said one of the unwashed, &#8216;them&#8217;s a pretty pair of red
	ribbands in your shoes; I want just such a pair for my little &#8217;un at
	home.&#8217;</p>


	<p>I knew there was only one way of dealing with them; I therefore
	put on one of my blandest smiles, and gently replied: &#8216;Well, my good
	fellow, if you will give me your address, I will send you a pair to-morrow.&#8217;
	This settled the affair in good humor, and I was suffered to reach
	the boat without farther annoyance. We had put into the stream but
	a short distance, when I encountered a boat-full of roysterers; for old
	father Thames was thickly studded on this occasion with boats of all
	classes; when one turned to another in the boat and cried out in the
	most lugubrious accents, which did not fail to excite shouts of laughter:</p>

	<p>&#8216;I say, Bill, is that &#8217;ere feller a man or a voman?&#8217;</p>

	<p>I thought now I had fairly passed my ordeal and might go on in peace;
	but no; we were obliged to pull in near shore, as we were rowing
	against tide. Milbank was crowded, and from the midst of the polite
	assemblage a gentle female voice cried out:</p>

	<p>&#8216;My eyes! Tom! if there isn&#8217;t one of Astley&#8217;s riders!&#8217;</p>

	<p>I at length arrived at my place of appointment, and had a good hearty
	laugh at breakfast over my little annoyances. While engaged in that
	interesting meal, the shouts of the people passed across the water. It
	was occasioned by the arrival of the Queen, who was refused admittance
	to the Abbey. Almost all parties blamed her for the attempt, nor
	did she produce the sensation she had evidently calculated upon. It
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page142" name="page142"></a>142</span>was like trying to renew a lost game, when all interest had subsided.
	It was the final blow to all her ambitious aspirations, which speedily
	ended, where all our vanities must end, in the silent grave. I wish it
	to be perfectly understood that I have no idea of entering into a rivalry
	with Hume, in giving another History of England; but as these events
	of stirring interest passed within my own time, and of which I was a
	close observer, I trust the introduction will not appear misplaced; taking
	into consideration that I profess to give my general reminiscences, and
	not simply to confine them to my profession. Perhaps it would be wise
	on my part to drop a veil over the gorgeous spectacle; for like a visit
	to the Falls of Niagara, the most enlarged description a prudent person
	ought to indulge in, would be simply, &#8216;I have seen the Falls;&#8217; so if I
	were to show my prudence, I should say, &#8216;I saw the Coronation.&#8217; But
	how is it possible to refrain from giving expression, however slight and
	sketchy, to scenes of such unexampled magnificence?</p>

	<p>We crossed the river at seven o&#8217;clock, and had the advantage of
	passing through the private residence of one of the principal officers of
	the House of Commons, and marched on to Westminster Hall without
	impediment. I had a distinct ticket for the Abbey where I had no duty
	to perform; and indeed throughout the day it was purely nominal. I
	had therefore all the advantages of passing and repassing at my own
	will and discretion, and of paying visits to the Palace-Yard to different
	friends who had secured places to witness the procession. On first
	entering that most magnificent of halls, it was impossible not to be
	struck with its gigantic proportions and superb embellishments. Galleries
	were erected for the peeresses, foreign ambassadors, and the most
	distinguished visitors. Admirable arrangements were also made for
	that portion of the public who had been so fortunate as to procure a
	Lord Chamberlain&#8217;s ticket. Costume also was strictly attended to here,
	no gentleman being admitted save in full court-suit or military uniform;
	and the ladies of course shone in all the splendor that gave grace to
	their lovely forms, and added a native lustre to all the artificial aids
	which gave such light and brilliancy to the glowing scene.</p>

	<p>The monotony of the early part of the morning was relieved by the
	absurd evolutions of the gentlemen from the cinque-ports who had the
	privilege of carrying the Canopy of the Cloth of Gold over His Majesty.
	If truth may be told on state occasions, it must be said that they did
	not perform their movements with much grace. They were not regularly
	disciplined troops, but fairly occupied the position of the &#8216;awkward
	squad.&#8217; It had the effect, however, of exciting a good deal of merriment;
	indeed I have seldom seen a rehearsal produce such striking
	effects. The high and imposing ceremonies of the Church, partaking
	largely of the grand and mystic formula which belonged to our cathedral
	service before the Reformation, and which again bids fair, at least
	partially, to occupy its altars, impressed upon the vast and brilliant
	assemblage gathered beneath the Gothic roof a mingled feeling of
	royalty and devotion, which was in former days the very essence of
	chivalry, and which seemed to have taken new growth in this advanced
	age, from the associating link of ancient costume, which met the eye
	at every turn. The austere and solemn silence of the place was lost
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page143" name="page143"></a>143</span>in the mingled feelings which occupied all hearts; and as the lofty
	chants of the church swelled into divine melody, a half-breathing, a
	solemn, suppressed emotion, spoke deeply to the heart of other realms
	above. It is impossible to hear the loud swell of the organ and exquisite
	melody of the varieties of the human voice harmoniously blended, and
	bursting forth together in one loud and glorious song of praise, without
	feeling that our destiny is more than earthly. It should be taken into
	consideration that there is a vast multitude on the outside, who are
	really getting impatient for their part of the pageant. It is true, those
	who have secured places in the different splendid pavilions erected in
	the immediate vicinity of the platform, are more at their ease, and with
	the aid of long purses can indulge in all the luxuries so amply provided
	by liberal caterers; but still &#8216;fair play&#8217; is our motto; and we will at
	once throw open the abbey-doors and marshal forth the most brilliant
	<i>cortége</i> that ever issued from its sacred walls; the herb-woman, Miss
	Fellows, and her attendants, strewing the path with flowers, blending the
	red rose and the white together, symbolical of the fact, that &#8216;no longer
	division racked the state,&#8217; but that unreserved allegiance was due to the
	monarch before them. The excitement of the morning with respect to
	the <span class="special_name">Queen</span> had not entirely subsided; and some few greetings must
	have caught the <span class="special_name">King&#8217;s</span> ear, that were not expressive of unbounded
	loyalty; but these formed a very slight proportion of the people. <span class="special_name">Lord
	Castlereagh</span> came in also for his share of these unseemly greetings;
	but his noble glance and really majestic appearance; his smile, not
	of disdain, but which marked an unflinching firmness of resolve;
	speedily converted their anger into applause. <span class="special_name">The Duke of York</span> and
	<span class="special_name">Prince Leopold</span> excited great interest by their dignified and elegant
	deportment. The <span class="special_name">King</span>, as he passed up the hall, was greeted with the
	most enthusiastic cheering and the waving of handkerchiefs from the
	élite of both sexes; but he appeared oppressed and worn down with
	fatigue, in which doubtless anxiety had its portion. His Majesty then
	retired to an apartment prepared for his reception, to take some repose
	during the royal banquet.</p>

	<p>The long tables running down the hall on each side were covered
	with rich damask; triumphal arches and every ingenious device that
	could by possibility bear upon the pageant, were lavishly placed upon
	the tables, splendidly ornamented with artificial flowers, rivalling the
	goddess Flora herself. The entrance to the hall was a grand Gothic
	archway; but one of the most singular effects produced, was by the
	numerous chandeliers in <i>ormolu</i> hanging from the lofty roof, sending
	forth myriads of little twinkling stars, that essayed to dim the light of
	the sun, who here and there sent in his beams through the narrow loopholes
	and windows of the hall, to catch a glimpse of the splendid ceremonies.
	The banquet commenced; and it was not a little amusing to
	see the city authorities maintain their charter by commencing a most
	formidable attack upon the turtle and the viands which were so profusely
	spread over the table. Not a moment was lost. Triumphal
	arches quickly assumed the appearance of shapeless ruins, and wines
	from every quarter of the globe paid a heavy duty upon being deposited
	in the city vats!</p>

	<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page144" name="page144"></a>144</span>At length the martial clangor of the trumpet announced the royal
	banquet. His Majesty took his seat on the <i>dais</i>, with the imperial crown
	upon his head amid the deafening shouts of the up-standing noblesse of
	the land. <span class="special_name">Lord Glengall&#8217;s</span> seat was high up in the hall; and next to
	him, on one side, was the <span class="special_name">Earl of Blessington</span>, whom I had the honor
	of knowing, and the <span class="special_name">Earl of Falmouth</span> on the other, both of whom are
	now gathered to their fathers. They insisted upon my taking a seat
	with them, to which of course I was nothing loath; and there I fully
	participated in all the luxuries of the table, instead of waiting like an humble
	page for the remains of the feast. Lord Blessington requested me
	to go into the peeresses&#8217; gallery and endeavour to procure refreshments
	for <span class="special_name">Lady Blessington</span>. I had never seen her ladyship; but her famed
	beauty and talents did not render the task one of great difficulty. Amid
	a blaze of beauty, I soon discovered the fair lady, to whom I was to enact
	my part of Esquire. In return for the attentions I had the good fortune
	to offer, I received most gracious smiles, and the blandest of speeches,
	and felt myself rise in stature as I again paced the ancient hall. At
	length one of the most imposing ceremonies commenced; and many a
	swan-like neck was stretched to catch a glimpse of the unapproachable
	magnificence of the scene; the entrance of the champion (accompanied
	by the hero of a thousand battles,) in a full suit of armor and superbly
	mounted on a white charger with a plume of feathers on its head; the
	<span class="special_name">Marquis of Anglesea</span>, similarly caparisoned; the <span class="special_name">Lord Howard</span> of
	Effingham, and others of comparatively less note. It had been whispered
	that Mr. Horace Seymour (now <span class="special_name">Sir Horace</span>,) had been selected
	by His Majesty for that important character, and his splendid appearance
	would perhaps under other circumstances have justified the choice. The
	right, however, was hereditary, and the real representative would indeed
	have shown craven, and unworthy the high distinction, if he had relinquished
	so honorable a position. The anecdote which is related at the
	coronation of George III., of the challenge having been accepted in behalf
	of <span class="special_name">Prince Charles Stuart</span>, after the gauntlet was dashed upon the
	earth, was here omitted; for here, happily, there was an undisputed
	succession. After the champion had drank to the health of &#8216;<span class="special_name">George the
	Fourth</span>, the rightful monarch of Great Britain,&#8217; in a cup of gold sent
	by His Majesty, (and which is retained by the champion,) he and the
	accompanying nobles backed their horses the whole distance down the
	hall, gracefully bowing to their monarch at distinct intervals, amid the
	most enthusiastic cheering.</p>


	<p><span class="special_name">Walter Scott</span> was there, his eye sparkling with delight, and devouring
	that magnificence of which <em>his</em> pen alone could convey the unlimited
	splendor. <i>Non nobis Domine</i> was given by a numerous choir most
	superbly; and the whole of the ceremonies were at length concluded.
	I left the hall with the loss of my cap and feathers, and in a humble
	beaver, which I borrowed from a friend in the immediate vicinity, I
	elbowed my way through the crowd, sated with splendor and fairly exhausted.
	London was a blaze of light, and Hyde Park, I presume for
	the first time, was brilliantly illuminated. Fireworks of the most dazzling
	description shot meteor-like from every open spot in the vast metropolis,
	and the pyrotechnical art displayed in the parks at the government
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page145" name="page145"></a>145</span>expense beggared all description. As I have already stated,
	Covent-Garden Theatre made a golden harvest by anticipating the
	coronation; but it was left for Drury-Lane to give as near as possible a
	fac-simile of the one that had so recently taken place. A platform was
	thrown over the centre of the pit, across which the procession took place.
	<span class="special_name">Elliston</span> repeated it so often to crowded houses, that at length he fancied
	himself the <span class="special_name">King</span> <i>de jure</i>; and his enthusiasm carried him to such
	an extent, that on one occasion he stopped suddenly in the centre of the
	platform, and with a most gracious and benignant smile, extended his
	arms at full length and gave the audience a regal blessing, in the following
	pithy sentence: &#8216;<em>Bless ye, my people!</em>&#8217;</p>

	<h2 class="title">REMINISCENCES OF A DARTMOOR PRISONER.</h2>
	<h3 class="subtitle">NUMBER ONE.</h3>


	<p><span class="first_word">It</span> was my fortune to be taken prisoner in India during the war of
	1812. I was, with others, confined in Fort William at Calcutta, for
	several months, until the authorities could find an opportunity to send
	us to England. At length the Bengal fleet being ready for their return
	voyage, the prisoners were distributed on board the several vessels
	which composed it. I was placed with a few others on board the
	&#8216;Lord Wellington,&#8217; and being in a destitute condition, I agreed to assist
	in working the ship to England, at the same rate as the regular hands
	on board. The fleet rendezvoused in the near vicinity, and consisted of
	something over thirty sail, most of them of the largest class, and equal
	in size to a line-of-battle ship. They were well armed, some carrying
	thirty or forty guns, with a plentiful supply of muskets, pikes, etc.
	This had been customary for many years, as a protection against the
	French privateers and men-of-war, which swarmed the Indian ocean;
	in many instances proving themselves more than a match for their
	enemies, and sometimes beating off large class frigates.</p>

	<p>On going on board, I found between four and five hundred people,
	including officers, passengers, and crew. The captain was a large
	heavy-built man, very unwieldy, and remarkable only for having a
	large, long body placed upon very small legs. He reminded me of an
	ill-constructed building, ready to fall by its own weight. He appeared
	never to be happy unless he was &#8216;in hot water,&#8217; either with the passengers
	or crew. There were six mates, or more properly lieutenants,
	for all the officers were in uniform. There were also a dozen or more
	midshipmen, a boatswain and his two mates, gunners, quarter-masters,
	armorers, sail-makers, and carpenters in abundance. In short, we
	were fitted out in complete man-of-war fashion; not forgetting the
	cat-o&#8217;-nine-tails, which was used with great liberality. The crew was
	made up of all nations, but the majority consisted of broken-down men-of-war&#8217;s
	men, who being unfit for His Majesty&#8217;s service had little fear
	of imprisonment. The others were composed of Portuguese, Dutch,
	Italian, etc.; and taken altogether, one would have inferred that they
	must have been drafted from Falstaff&#8217;s regiment of taterdamallions.</p>

	<p>One fine morning the fleet got under way. Nothing note-worthy or
	interesting however occurred until we made the island of Ceylon, where
	we lay a couple of days; during which time the crew <em>got</em> and <em>kept</em> most
	unaccountably drunk. The officers tried every method to solve the
	mystery, but without effect. The truth was, the men became suddenly
	fond of cocoa-nuts, selecting them from the bum-boats in preference to
	any other fruit. The secret was, that the shell was bored before the nut
	was quite ripe, the juice poured out, and <i>Arrack</i> substituted in its
	place. Our next place of stopping was Madras, where we took in
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page147" name="page147"></a>147</span>more cargo, but no more cocoa-nuts, as no fruit-boats put off to us,
	the weather being too rough to admit of it.</p>

	<p>We had now been at sea several weeks, and had many among our
	crew and passengers upon the sick-list. Of the former, was a young
	man on his first voyage. He had been ill more than a week, and there
	being no physician on board, there was little or nothing done for him.
	At length he became delirious at intervals; and during the whole of
	the last night of his existence he made the most piercing and heart-rending
	cries; calling incessantly for his mother and sister, and
	lamenting that he should never see them more. Poor fellow! before the
	next night he was sewed up in his hammock, with a couple of shot at
	his feet; prayers were read over him, and in the presence of his silent
	and pensive ship-mates, he was consigned to the ocean, that vast and
	sublime grave of countless millions of our race. Several weeks after
	this occurrence, one of the passengers, a Frenchman, died of the consumption,
	and was buried in the same way; and had not the subject
	been of too serious a nature, the event would have partaken somewhat
	of the ludicrous. As usual, the shot was placed at the feet of the dead
	body, but proved to be insufficient to sink it. The consequence was,
	that the head and shoulders remained above the surface, bobbing up and
	down, until we lost sight of it in the distance. The captain&#8217;s clerk
	always officiated as Chaplain at the funerals and divine service;
	which latter, by the way, was more of a farce than any thing else; for
	I have known more than one instance where they have been interrupted
	in the very midst by a squall of wind. Then to see the hubbub; the
	congregation dispersed; some ordered aloft, with such pious (though
	sometimes more forcible) ejaculations as: &#8216;Lay aloft there, you lubbers!
	<span class="keep_together">D&#8212;n</span> your bloods! I&#8217;ll see your back-bones! I&#8217;ll set the cat at
	you!&#8217; etc.</p>

	<p>We now approached the Cape of Good Hope. The weather became
	lowering; and as the day advanced, heavy masses of black clouds gradually
	arose above the horizon, and palled the sky. Night came on
	suddenly, and with it the threatened storm in all its fury. The darkness
	was as it were the quintessence of an ink-bottle. <em>Nothing</em> could be
	seen, save when the lightning gleamed, or when the rockets which were
	sent up from the Commodore, and broke forth, spreading their lurid,
	baleful light to give notice to the squadron of their position; then for an
	instant the whole scene was lit up with a hideous glare, when all would
	subside again into tenfold darkness. This, accompanied by the whistling
	of the wind, the roar of thunder, and the booming of a gun at intervals
	from the Commodore, to give notice for putting about, gave a
	grandeur and sublimity to the scene, which I have never seen surpassed.
	Fear gave way to excitement; and the idea of perishing amid
	this terrible war of the elements was worth years of the monotony of
	every-day life. I thought too of the Flying Dutchman, but did not fall
	in with him until some time after, and then it was by day-light, and
	without the poetry of &#8216;darkness, and cloud, and storm.&#8217;</p>

	<p>The tempest gradually subsided, and at the end of two or three days
	scarcely a breath of wind was to be felt. Angry Nature had changed
	her frowns for sportive smiles; the face of the great deep was like polished
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page148" name="page148"></a>148</span>glass; but there was a long swell of the ocean, apparently of miles in
	length; its bosom heaving and sinking, as if still oppressed with its late
	troubles. Our ship lay utterly unmanageable, her sails flapping idly
	against the masts. There was not sufficient wind to make her answer
	the helm; and there we lay, rolling and plunging, expecting every moment
	to see our masts go by the board. The lower yards dipped at every
	roll; and so great was the strain, that it drew the strong iron ring-bolts
	by which the guns were secured, and the lashings which fastened the
	large water-butts broke loose. This was at night; and the power and
	speed with which these heavy articles were driven from side to side was
	truly terrific. It took all hands the whole night, (and not without great
	danger) to secure them. The next day, a new and greater danger presented
	itself in a different form. A large ship, about the size of our
	own, lay in the same helpless condition; and by reason of a current, or
	some other cause, approached so near that it became truly alarming.
	Both vessels were rolling their keels nearly out of the water; and had
	they come in contact, it would have been certain destruction to both.
	It was necessary that something should be done immediately; and the
	crews of both vessels were ordered into their respective boats, with
	lines attached to the ships; and with several hours&#8217; hard labor at the
	oars, they were enabled to separate them.</p>

	<p>It was about this time that I had a view, not of the Flying Dutchman
	exactly, but of his ship, while standing on the forecastle early one morning.
	There had been a fog during the night, and a portion of the vapor
	still hung over the surface of the water. I had remained in that position
	but a few moments, when my attention was called by the boatswain&#8217;s-mate,
	who stood near by: &#8216;Look yonder!&#8217; said he, pointing with his finger.
	I looked in the direction indicated, and lo! there lay the mystic
	&#8216;Phantom Ship.&#8217; She was only a few yards off; perfectly becalmed,
	with no more motion than if painted on canvass, and apparently not over
	six feet long, yet perfect in every respect. I was gazing in admiration,
	with my eyes rivetted upon the object, when there came a light breath
	of air, so light that I could hardly feel it; presently the mist began
	gradually to rise and disperse; the ship began to recede; the magic
	scene was at an end! A breeze had sprung up, and the phantom-ship
	proved to be one of the fleet; and by a signal from the Commodore, she
	took her station in line with the other vessels. I never saw any
	thing like it before nor since. The atmospheric delusion was astonishing;
	but it was nothing new to the old boatswain&#8217;s-mate. All the other
	vessels were obscured by the fog, and this happened to be the nearest to
	us. Had the others been in sight they might (or might not) have presented
	the same appearance. Possibly the position of that particular
	ship helped to produce the effect. The sight of so large a fleet formed in
	two lines, extending four or five miles, each convoyed by a man-of-war,
	like a troop of soldiers led on in single-file by its officers, was &#8216;beautiful
	exceedingly;&#8217; especially when the rising or setting sun illuminated
	their white sails, and a signal-gun from the Commodore changed their
	course; every ship in that vast fleet, at the cry of &#8216;About ship!&#8217; moving
	as by one mind, and gracefully bowing to, and as it were saluting, the
	breeze! It was a scene never to be forgotten.</p>


	<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page149" name="page149"></a>149</span>The wind gradually increased until it became a smart breeze, and we
	soon neared the Island of St. Helena. Here we first heard of the
	downfall of <span class="special_name">Napoleon</span>, the greatest warrior of all ages; one who struck
	such terror into the souls of combined Europe, that they dared not let
	him go free, and imposed upon Great Britain the honorable task of becoming
	his jailor; and her very heart quaked within her bosom while
	life remained in his; doomed though he was to perpetual and hopeless
	exile, upon an isolated rock in the midst of the ocean. On seeing the yellow
	flags, with the motto &#8216;<i>Orange boven</i>,&#8217; flying at the mast-heads of the
	shipping, and hearing of the overthrow of the power of France, our old
	Dutch boatswain&#8217;s-mate, (who in his youth had served with the brave
	Admiral De Winter, and who had braved the &#8216;battle and the breeze&#8217; for
	more than half a century,) was touched to the very depths of his stout
	heart. He was completely melted, and wept like a child over the fallen
	fortunes of <span class="special_name">Napoleon</span>. &#8216;Holland,&#8217; said he, &#8216;has lost her best friend.
	Who like him will watch over and protect my country!&#8217;  He was naturally
	of a cheerful disposition; but from that time to the close of the
	voyage, he appeared sad and disheartened, and a smile scarce ever
	came over his countenance. I may remark in passing, that there were
	on board of our ship some ten or fifteen Dutch prisoners, who were the
	remnant of a large force that had formerly been garrisoned at the
	island of Java. All but these few had been gradually wasted away by
	pestilence and the poisoned spears and knives of the natives; and Holland,
	being so much engaged in her wars at home, had no means of aiding
	so distant a colony. Such was their condition when the island fell
	into the hands of the English; and they were rescued from destruction
	by the natives, only by becoming prisoners of war to the English.
	They were all old men, and some of them could speak a little English:
	they used to relate to me their former condition, and talk of their future
	prospects. The tale was a sad one. When young they were &#8216;kidnapped,&#8217;
	as they termed it, by the government, as no volunteers could be
	got to serve in that sickly climate.  They were forced from home and
	their parents at a tender age and sent to that far country, whence they
	had no prospect of ever returning, or hearing from their friends. Some
	of them had been absent for forty years, during which time they had
	seen none of their connexions, and seldom heard from them; for many
	years all intercourse had been dropped. They felt themselves entire
	strangers in the world; they were going to Holland to be sure, but not
	to their home. After the lapse of so many years, where could they
	seek for their friends? Death and other causes had removed and scattered
	them; and they almost dreaded the time when they should again
	set their feet upon the land of their fathers. Having been many months
	their associate in imprisonment, I took a deep interest in these poor fellows;
	participated in their feelings, and parted from them with regret.
	Peace to their memories!  They have without doubt long ere this
	ended their weary pilgrimage of life.</p>


	<p>We remained at St. Helena several weeks, waiting for the China
	fleet, during which time we took in a fresh supply of provisions, water,
	etc. This now famed island is nothing more nor less than a huge irregular
	block of granite, rising perpendicularly from the midst of the sea.
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page150" name="page150"></a>150</span>The town, what there is of it, is built in a gully or chasm in the rock:
	the inhabitants are composed mostly of the military establishment and
	those connected with it, with perhaps a few exceptions. The island is
	only useful as a stopping-place for outward and homeward bound India-men,
	etc; and the inhabitants would be in a state of starvation, were
	it not for the supplies of provisions which they obtain from the shipping
	which put in there. All manner of coins from all manner of countries
	are in circulation here; and all copper coin goes for a penny, be it
	twice the size of a dollar, or as small as a five-cent piece. A person
	that way minded might soon make a large and curious collection here.</p>

	<p>The China fleet now made its appearance, and after a few days&#8217;
	delay we all got under weigh, with a convoy of a frigate, a sloop-of-war,
	and a transport full of troops, who on their arrival in England
	were ordered immediately to the United States, where they were sadly
	cut up at the battle of New-Orleans. We left the island with a stiff
	breeze, which continued with fine clear weather for several days. The
	fleet amounted to over seventy sail, and was arranged in two lines;
	and in fine weather, with all sail set, we composed a beautiful spectacle.
	During the whole of the voyage the utmost precaution was used to prevent
	an attack or capture by privateers, or national vessels of the
	enemy. Lights of every kind were strictly forbidden at night, except
	through a special order from a superior officer, and a double watch
	was kept day and night.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Land, ho!&#8217; cried the look-out at the mast-head, one day. It proved
	to be what is termed the Western Islands, which lay directly ahead of
	us. &#8216;Sail, ho!&#8217; was the next cry; and all eyes were turned toward
	the strangers. They were two &#8216;long, low, black-looking schooners,&#8217;
	lying-to very quietly, about three miles ahead.  &#8216;See the <span class="keep_together">d&#8212;&#8212;d</span>
	Yankees!&#8217; shouted all hands, in full chorus, as the American flag was
	displayed at their gaff. A thrill shot through my nerves; my heart
	swelled, and my eyes filled with tears, as I beheld the Flag of my
	Country for the first time for many months. No one can imagine the
	love he bears his native land, until he tests it as I have done. Many
	were the speculations as to the probability of capturing the saucy privateersman;
	for by this time all the sail that the convoy could possibly
	set was spread in chase of the enemy, who as yet had made no attempt
	to fly, although apparently but a stone&#8217;s throw ahead of us. Our captain
	was the only one in my hearing who seemed to doubt their being
	taken: &#8216;The <span class="keep_together">d&#8212;&#8212;d</span> scamps know too well,&#8217; said he, &#8216;what their craft
	can do, to trust themselves so near us.&#8217; We now appeared close on
	board of them, and the chase well under way, when each fired a gun
	in defiance or derision, and darted off like birds. It was now nearly
	dark, and we were not far from land, for which one of the schooners
	seemed to fly right before the wind, closely pursued by the frigate, under
	all the canvass she could set. The other put out to sea, close-hauled
	upon the wind. The brig and transport, the fastest craft in the fleet,
	crowded all sail, but without nearing the schooner, as she could lie at
	least two points more to windward than her pursuers. They both
	escaped! The frigate being disabled, by springing her fore-top-mast,
	gave up the chase; the others relinquished the pursuit as fruitless, and
	rejoined the fleet.</p>

	<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page151" name="page151"></a>151</span>The night was extremely dark; and the next morning two large
	vessels were missing. It seemed that the privateers had returned, and
	hovering around, watched their opportunity, and captured two of our
	most richly-freighted ships; but as those seas were swarming with
	British cruisers, they were shortly re-captured and sent to England,
	where the whole fleet soon arrived. The West-India fleet came into
	port about the same time; and the amount of wealth brought into London
	by the safe arrival of the Bengal, China, and West-India fleets,
	must have been almost incredible. For myself, I was consigned to a
	dreary prison, &#8216;as will more particularly appear&#8217; in an ensuing number.</p>

	<h2 class="title">A VERITABLE SEA STORY.</h2>
	<h3 class="byline">BY HARRY FRANCO.</h3>
	<div class="poem">
	<div class="stanza">
	<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">The</span> sea, the sea, the o&#8212;pen sea, the blue, the <em>fresh</em>;&#8217; but here we halt;</p>
	<p>Mr. <span class="special_name">Cornwall</span> knew very little about the sea, or he would have written <span class="small_all_caps">SALT</span>.</p>
	<p class="i8">&#8216;The whales they whistled, the porpoise rolled,</p>
	<p class="i8">And the dolphins bared their backs of gold;&#8217;</p>
	<p>Worse and worse; more blunders than words, and such a jumble!</p>
	<p>Whales <em>spout</em>, but never whistle; dolphins&#8217; backs are silver; and porpoises never roll, but tumble.</p>
	<p class="i8">&#8216;It plays with the clouds, it mocks the skies,</p>
	<p class="i8">And like a cradled creature lies,&#8217; and squalls,</p>
	<p class="i8">He should have added; but to avoid brawls</p>
	<p>With the poet&#8217;s friends I&#8217;ll quote no more; but <i>entre nous</i>,</p>
	<p>Those who write correctly about the sea are exceeding few.</p>
	<p>Young <span class="special_name">Dana</span> with us, and <span class="special_name">Marryat</span> over the water,<a href="#fn1" class="fnmarker" title="I have unintentionally omitted..." id="fnm1" name="fnm1">1</a></p>
	<p>Are all the writers that I know of, who appear to have brought a</p>
	<p>Discerning eye to bear on that peculiar state of existence,</p>
	<p>An ocean life, which looks so romantic at a distance.</p>
	<p>To succeed where every body else fails, would be an uncommon glory,</p>
	<p>While to fail would be no disgrace; so I am resolved to try my hand upon a sea-story.</p>
	<p>In naming sea-authors, I omitted <span class="special_name">Cooper</span>, <span class="special_name">Chamier</span>, <span class="special_name">Sue</span>, and many others,</p>
	<p>Because they appear to have gone to sea without asking leave of their mothers:</p>
	<p>For those good ladies never could have consented that their boys should dwell on</p>
	<p>An element that Nature never fitted them to excel on.</p>
	<p>Their descriptions are so fine, and their tars so exceedingly flowery,</p>
	<p>They appear to have gathered their ideas from some naval spectacle at the &#8216;Bowery;&#8217;</p>
	<p>And in fact I have serious doubts whether either of them ever saw blue water,</p>
	<p>Or ever had the felicity of saluting the &#8216;gunner&#8217;s daughter.&#8217;</p>
	</div>
	<div class="stanza">
	<p>It was on board of the packet &#8212;&#8212;, from feelings deferential</p>
	<p>To private griefs, I omit all facts that are non-essential:</p>
	<p>To Havre we were bound, and passengers there were four of us,</p>
	<p>Three men and a lady&#8212;not an individual more of us.</p>
	<p>The month was July, the weather warm and hazy,</p>
	<p>The sea smooth as glass, the winds asleep or lazy.</p>
	<p>Dull times of course, for the sea, though favorable to the mind&#8217;s expansion,</p>
	<p>Yet keeps the body confined to a very few feet of stanchion.</p>
	<p>Our employments were nought save eating, drinking and sleeping,</p>
	<p>Excepting the lady, who a diary was keeping.</p>
	<p>She was a very pleasant person though fat, and a long way past forty,</p>
	<p>Which will of course prevent any body from thinking any thing naughty.</p>
	<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page152" name="page152"></a>152</span>A very pleasant person, but such an enormous feeder,</p>
	<p>That our captain began to fear she might prove a famine-breeder;</p>
	<p>A sort of female Falstaff, fond of jokes and gay society,</p>
	<p>Cards, claret, eau-de-vie, and a great hater of sobriety.</p>
	<p>Her favorite game at cards she acknowledged was <i>ecarté</i>,</p>
	<p>But like Mrs. Battle, she loved whist, and we soon made up a party.</p>
	<p>We played from morn till night, and then from night till morning,</p>
	<p>Although the captain, who was pious, continually gave us warning.</p>
	<p>That time so badly spent would lead to some disaster;</p>
	<p>At which Madame <span class="keep_together">G&#8212;&#8212;</span> would laugh, and only deal the faster.</p>
	<p>Breakfast was served at eight, and as soon as it was ended</p>
	<p>Round flew the cards; and the game was not suspended</p>
	<p>Until seven-bells struck, when we stopped a while for lunch,</p>
	<p>To allow Madame time to imbibe her allowance of punch;</p>
	<p>This done, at work we went, with heated blood and flushed faces,</p>
	<p>Talking of kings, queens, knaves, tricks, clubs and aces.</p>
	<p>At six bells (three <span class="small_all_caps">P. M.</span>,) we threw down our cards and went to dinner,</p>
	<p>Where Madame never missed her appetite, whether she had been a loser or a winner;</p>
	<p>Then up from the almonds and raisins, and down again to the queens and aces,</p>
	<p>We had only to remove from one end of the table to the other to resume our places;</p>
	<p>Another pause at six, <span class="small_all_caps">P. M.</span>, for in spite of all our speeches,</p>
	<p>Madame&#8217;s partner would lay down his cards for the sake of pouchong and brandy peaches;</p>
	<p>Being French and polite, of course, she only said &#8216;<i>Eh bien!</i>&#8217; but no doubt thought him a lubber,</p>
	<p>For a cup of washy tea to break in upon her rubber.</p>
	<p>At four bells (ten <span class="small_all_caps">P. M.</span>,) up from the cards and down again at the table,</p>
	<p>To drink champaigne and eat cold chicken as long as we were able:</p>
	<p>With very slight variations this was the daily life we led,</p>
	<p>Breakfast, whist; lunch, whist; dinner, whist; supper, whist; and then to bed.</p>
	<p>The sea, for aught we know, was like that which Coleridge&#8217;s mariners sailed on;</p>
	<p>We never looked at it, nor the sky, nor the stars; and our captain railed on,</p>
	<p>But still we played, until one day there was a sudden dismemberment of our party;</p>
	<p>We had dined on soup <i>à la tortu</i>, (made of pig&#8217;s feet,) of which Madame ate uncommonly hearty;</p>
	<p>And had just resumed our game; it was her cut, but she made no motion;</p>
	<p>&#8216;Cut, Madame,&#8217; said I; &#8216;Good Heavens!&#8217; exclaimed her partner, &#8216;I&#8217;ve a notion</p>
	<p>That she <em>has</em> cut for good; quick! help her! she&#8217;s falling!&#8217;</p>
	<p>And the next moment on the floor of the cabin she lay sprawling.</p>
	<p>Poor Madame! It was in vain that we tried hartshorne, bathing and bleeding;</p>
	<p>Her spirit took its flight, tired to death of her high feeding:</p>
	<p>For spirits are best content with steady habits and spare diet,</p>
	<p>And will remain much longer in a tabernacle where they can enjoy repose and quiet</p>
	<p>Than in a body that is continually uneasy with stuffing,</p>
	<p>And goes about like an overloaded porter, sweating and puffing.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="stanza">
	<p>The next morning at four-bells, the sun was just uprisen,</p>
	<p>Glowing with very joy to leave his watery prison;</p>
	<p>The bright cerulean waves with golden scales were crested,</p>
	<p>Forming the fairest scene on which my eyes had ever rested;</p>
	<p>The wind was <span class="small_all_caps">S. S. W.</span>, and when they let go the main-top bowline</p>
	<p>To square the after yards, our good ship stopped her rolling.</p>
	<p>Madame lay on the quarter-deck sewed up in part of an old spanker,</p>
	<p>And for this glorious sight of the ocean we had solely to thank her,</p>
	<p>For to have kept her lying in the cabin would have caused some of us to feel qualmish,</p>
	<p>And she could not have been kept on deck, as the weather was growing warmish;</p>
	<p>Therefore it had been resolved in a kind of council, on the captain&#8217;s motion,</p>
	<p>At sunrise to commit the old lady to the ocean.</p>
	<p>She was placed upon a plank, resting upon the taffrail, (the stern railing,)</p>
	<p>One end of which was secured by a bight of the trysail brailing.</p>
	<p>The captain read the prayers, somewhat curtailed, but a just proportion,</p>
	<p>The plank was raised, &#8216;Amen!&#8217; the corpse dropped into the ocean.</p>
	<p>Down in its deep mysterious caves she sunk to sleep with fishes,</p>
	<p>While a few bubbles rose from her and burst as if in mockery of human wishes.</p>
	<p>&#8216;Up with your helm; brace round; haul out your bowlines;</p>
	<p>Clear up the deck; keep her full; coil down your tow-lines!&#8217;</p>
	<p>The ship was on her course, and not a word said to remind us</p>
	<p>Of the melancholy fact that we had left one of our number behind us.</p>
	<p>&#8216;Shocking affair!&#8217; I remarked to Madame&#8217;s partner, who looked solemn as a mummy,</p>
	<p>&#8216;O! horrid!&#8217; said he; &#8216;<em>I shall now be compelled to play with a Dummy!</em>&#8217;</p>

	</div>

	<p><span class="first_word">Let</span> us put on one side for a few moments the horrid midnight murder
	of the gracious Duncan. Let us suppose of the buried majesty of
	Scotland,</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<div class="stanza">
			<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8216;Upward to Heaven he took his flight,</p>
			<p>If ever soul ascended!&#8217;</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>Let us for the moment imagine Mrs. Siddons to have been the veritable
	Lady Macbeth, and acknowledge that never was man more powerfully
	tempted into evil, nor more deeply punished with his fall from Virtue,
	than this, the Thane of Glamis and of Cawdor. My concernment in this
	Essay is neither with his virtue, nor his fall. I neither come to praise, nor
	bury Cæsar:</p>

	<div class="poem">
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>&#8216;Go, bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,</p>
		<p>She strike upon the bell. Get <em>thee</em> to bed.&#8217;</p>
	</div>
	</div>

	<p>In the reading I desire should be here given to the language of the immortal
	bard, it will be perceived that the last pronoun is made emphatic.
	&#8216;Get <em>thee</em> to bed.&#8217;</p>

	<p>The household of the castle of Macbeth, excited and disturbed as its
	members had been throughout the day by the unexpected arrival of the
	King of Scotland at Inverness, are now subsiding into rest. The King
	has retired. His suite are provided for in various parts of the quadrangle;
	and all the tumultuary sounds of preparation and of festive
	enjoyment have followed the departed day; and Banquo charged with
	a princely gift to the Lady Macbeth under the title of <em>most kind hostess</em>,
	from her confiding and now slumbering monarch, has paid his compliments
	and gone.</p>

	<p>Now comes the deeper stillness, and the witching hour of that eventful
	night; and the noble Thane, having gone the rounds of his hushed
	castle to place all entrances under both watch and ward, turns to his
	torch-bearer, the last remaining household servant of the train, and
	dismisses him with the message I have read. The words excite no surprise
	in the mind of the attendant. He receives the command and departs
	upon his errand; to deliver it as had doubtless been his office before,
	and then retire for the night:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<div class="stanza">
			<p>&#8216;Go, bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,</p>
			<p>She strike upon the bell.&#8217;</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>Admired Editor, I have now that to say in thine ear that may possibly
	startle thy preceptions, shock thy wishes, and for the moment interfere
	with thy store of tragick recollection. I would have thee imagine
	with me, that Macbeth, stifling all murderous intent, and all disloyal
	thought, had honestly gone down at the sound of the bell, and, as must
	have been his wont as is shewn from the manner in which his attendant receives
	the charge, had soberly partaken of the warm and grateful drink
	his noble partner had prepared for his refreshing and composing use.</p>

	<p>Imagine the illustrious and majestick pair, their household having
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page154" name="page154"></a>154</span>entirely withdrawn, seated in the deep silence of the night, on either
	side of a small table as was their happy wont, and gently, calmly, dispassionately,
	and elegantly sipping that prepared beverage; that &#8216;drink
	made ready&#8217; by hands then yet innocent and spotless. Imagine the
	ingredients of which that dilution must have been composed! Not
	wine for wine is always &#8216;ready.&#8217; O call it not by any other W! Let
	it not be named Glenlivet; think not upon Ferintosh. It was <span class="small_all_caps">PURE
	REALITY IN THE LUSTRE OF A MILD GLORIFICATION</span>, <em>mingled with droppings
	of the dew of morning</em>.</p>

	<p>They say that the mind of man is a mere bundle of associations, and
	that our success in moving it to our purpose depends on our awakening
	the most powerful, or most agreeable of them. I know not of what
	associations that of the reader may be composed; but for my own part
	I think a little warm drink before going to bed upon a night when owls
	hoot and chimnies are to be blown down, prepared by the small hands that
	one loves, and that all admire; where a dimple takes place of what in a
	plebeian hand is a knuckle, and the round fingers taper gently off toward
	points that are touched with damask and bordered with little rims of ivory;
	where bright eyes beam with kindness as well as wit; and words fall in
	silvery tones from a beautifully-formed mouth, like the renewal of life
	upon the soul of man! I think where one could enjoy all this, it was a
	monstrous act of folly on the part of Macbeth to fret about the principality
	of Cumberland, or covet even the whole kingdom of Scotland. For my
	own part I must say, give me the warm drink and the sweet companionship
	of that night, and let old Duncan with a hearty welcome sleep up
	to his heart&#8217;s content the whole &#8216;ravelled sleeve of care!&#8217;</p>

	<p>Oh Woman! dear, good, kind, blessed, beautiful Woman! chosen of
	Heaven (and O how well!) for the meet companion of our otherwise
	forlorn race! is there a moment throughout that whole circle of the Sun
	which we call Day more sweet to us, than that which follows the well-performed
	duties of our lot and that gives thee altogether to us at its
	close, gentle, refined, affectionate, soothing, bland, and unreserved? The
	hour that precedes retirement for the night, when the early luxury of
	languor begins to take possession of the senses? When the eyes are
	not heavy, but threaten to become so, and long silken lashes first make
	love to each other? When it is time to confine part of that rich hair
	en papilotte and fold the whole into that pretty cap; to place the feet in
	small graceful slippers, and let ease put fashion tastefully on one side
	in the arrangement of the dress?</p>

	<p>Doubtless there is a period during the delirium of youthful fancy
	when the calmer pleasures are unappreciated at their value, but the
	Andante of existence follows the Allegro of boyhood; its precious strains
	fall deeper and more touchingly upon the Sense; and the full Soul longs
	to yield itself to them, and to share its emotions with the beloved one in
	tones heard only in her ivory <span class="keep_together">ear&#8212;&#8212;how</span> beautiful! Oh pure of heart,
	how <span class="keep_together">beautiful!&#8212;&#8212;and</span>, when the belle, still delighting to please, has become
	the friend; and the mistress, still fascinating, the wife; and one
	interest, one faith, one hope, one joy, one passion, one life, animate both
	<span class="keep_together">hearts&#8212;&#8212;oh</span> then,</p>

	<h2 class="title">THE SMITHY.</h2>
	<h3 class="byline">BY ALFRED B. STREET.</h3>
	<div class="poem">
	<div class="stanza">
	<p><span class="first_word">There</span> was a little smithy at the comer of the road,</p>
	<p>In the village where, when life glow&#8217;d fresh and bright, was my abode;</p>
	<p>A little slab-roof&#8217;d smithy, of a stain&#8217;d and dusky red,</p>
	<p>An ox-frame standing by the door, and at one side a shed;</p>
	<p>The road was lone and pleasant, with margins grassy-green,</p>
	<p>Where browsing cows and nibbling geese from morn till night were seen.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p>High curl&#8217;d the smoke from the humble roof with dawning&#8217;s earliest bird,</p>
	<p>And the tinkle of the anvil first of the village sounds was heard;</p>
	<p>The bellows-puff, the hammer-beat, the whistle and the song,</p>
	<p>Told, steadfastly and merrily, Toil roll&#8217;d the hours along,</p>
	<p>Till darkness fell, and the smithy then with its forge&#8217;s clear deep light</p>
	<p>Through chimney, window, door, and cleft, poured blushes on the night.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p>The morning shows its azure breast and scarf of silvery fleece,</p>
	<p>The margin-grass is group&#8217;d with cows, and spotted with the geese;</p>
	<p>On the dew-wet green by the smithy, there&#8217;s a circle of crackling fire,</p>
	<p>Hurrah! how it blazes and curls around the coal-man&#8217;s welded tire!</p>
	<p>While o&#8217;er it, with tongs, are the smith and his man, to fit it when cherry-red,</p>
	<p>To the tilted wheel of the huge grim&#8217;d ark in the back-ground of the shed.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p>There&#8217;s a stony field on the ridge to plough, and Brindle must be shod,</p>

	<p>But John and Timothy hammer away, until each hoof is arm&#8217;d,</p>

	<p>Joe Matson&#8217;s horse wants shoeing, and at even-tide he&#8217;s seen,</p>
	<p>An old gray sluggish creature, with his master on the green;</p>
	<p>Within the little smithy old Dobbin Matson draws,</p>
	<p>There John is busily twisting screws, and Timothy filing saws;</p>
	<p>The bellows sleeps, the forge is cold, and twilight dims the room,</p>

	<p>And now the forge is raked high up, now bursts it to a glare;</p>

	<h2 class="title">THE FINE ARTS.</h2>
	<h3 class="subtitle">A FEW HINTS ON THE PHILOSOPHY OF SIZE IN ITS RELATION TO THE FINE ARTS.</h3>
	<h2 class="byline">BY GEORGE HARVEY.</h2>


	<p><span class="first_word">It</span> is a common remark made by most persons who visit the mightiest
	cataract in the world, that it fails to impress one&#8217;s mind with that just
	idea of its grandeur which truly belongs to its vastness, and which is
	always formed from attentively reading or listening to a correct verbal
	or written description of it. Even the most faithful drawings cannot
	awaken an adequate conception of the majesty, the greatness of <span class="special_name">Niagara</span>.
	Now the law of optics will serve to convince us that this must ever be
	so, since the image formed in the dark chamber of the eye is exceedingly
	small; and as the Falls are always approached gradually from a
	distance, the surrounding landscape occupies by far the largest portion
	of the field of vision; hence the descending stream can only sustain a
	subordinate part in the general view; but when you have approached
	the very verge of the precipice over which the rolling waters rush with
	maddening roar; or when, from beneath, you stand upon the piles of
	broken rocks, and look upward or around, and can only embrace a small
	portion of the falling waters; then and then only, do the anticipated
	emotions crowd upon the soul, causing it to stand in trembling awe,
	vibrating in unison with the fragments of the fallen precipice upon
	which you tread.</p>

	<p>I remember some years since, in looking at an image of the &#8216;American
	Falls&#8217; reflected in a camera-obscura which was built on the opposite
	shore, noticing how extremely insignificant it appeared, notwithstanding
	the table of vision was five feet in diameter. The descending foam as
	it was unevenly projected in billowy masses, appeared to move very
	slowly in its downward course, causing a feeling of impatience at its
	tardiness: in truth, the whole scene looked very tame and unsatisfactory,
	and I could not help remarking to a friend who was with me, how utterly
	impossible it would be for any artist to be thought successful in an
	attempt to represent them. Nevertheless I made some twenty sketches
	from as many different points of view; one only of which has procured
	any commendation, as conveying an idea of the grandeur of the Great
	Cataract. It is evident therefore that what the eye can take in at
	one look will never of itself impress the mind with those sublime emotions
	which we conceive should belong to vastness. Yet there is a
	physical attribute belonging to subjects having this property of vastness,
	that will command more attention than the same scene upon a small
	scale: but the mind must be impressed with the fact, and must draw
	largely upon it for any emotion of the sublime. It is therefore upon this
	principle that large portraits will command from the multitude more applause
	than small miniatures; large oil-paintings than small water-color
	drawings. The statues on the outside of the Grecian temples
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page157" name="page157"></a>157</span>were colossal, yet in their position they looked small. Most of the
	works of Michael Angelo are so; but in consequence of the distance
	at which they are seen, they lose greatly their power to produce grand
	ideas, because in all cases the image formed upon the optic nerve varies
	but little in its actual size; since the distance at which things are viewed
	is in some degree regulated by the size: thus before a large picture,
	you must station yourself at a relative distance, so as to embrace the
	whole, while before the small drawing you must be within arm&#8217;s reach;
	or if a miniature portrait, it must be seen within a few inches, thus
	making the mirrored picture on the eye vary but little in actual size.</p>

	<p>These few hints will readily account for the mortification experienced
	by many artists who have painted exceedingly impressive pictures when
	they are seen in the studios where they were executed, but when they
	are taken into a large gallery or rotunda, seem lost and look insignificant,
	save to the few of cultivated minds, who may take the trouble to
	approach within a proper distance, and shut out all objects which interfere
	or intrude, and which prevent a true appreciation of their merits.
	The knowing, time-serving artists, who paint exhibition pictures, have
	long since understood this law; and accordingly they paint up to what
	is called &#8216;<em>exhibition-pitch</em>,&#8217; where brilliance and flashiness of color, with
	an absence of detail, which might interfere with breadth of effect, are
	of the first importance. Attention is also given to masses of light and
	shade, that all the forms introduced in the picture may have their due
	prominence; and a judicious balancing of warm and cool tints, by which
	harmony is produced, and the eye prevented from being offended by its
	evident exaggeration of the &#8216;modesty of nature.&#8217;</p>

	<p><span class="special_name">Turner</span> may be instanced as the most successful in this style of
	painting, which he has followed to such an extreme, that his pictures
	are now attractive only at a great distance, for when they are seen near
	by, they fail to please, if they do not produce positive disgust. Report
	represents him as having accumulated upward of one hundred thousand
	pounds sterling, which he could only have done by adopting this distant,
	effective style; for if he had continued to finish his pictures in the
	same manner as he did those of his early works, which procured for
	him the foundation of his present wide-spread reputation, he would not
	have realized one eighth of that sum. To paint one of the former,
	costs but a few hours&#8217; labor, but one of the latter would employ many
	days if not weeks; yet the momentary effect of pleasure derived from
	seeing the one is greater than that of the other. Hence those who visit
	exhibitions, having but a limited time, are gratified; but place one of
	the chaste productions of <span class="special_name">Claude Lorraine</span>, who diligently followed nature
	with all the tenderness of a modest student, by the side of one of
	the tinsel class, and observe the ultimate effect. The former will
	gradually win your admiration, and continue to arouse pleasing reminiscences;
	the latter will finally lose its charm, and be regarded with
	something of the feeling with which one looks upon the ornamental
	paper of a room. We have had many exhibitions of single large pictures,
	such as <span class="special_name">Dubufe&#8217;s</span> &#8216;Don Juan,&#8217; which have produced handsome
	returns to those who have purchased them for such speculating purposes.
	The parties have been well aware of the physical effects of size; for
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page158" name="page158"></a>158</span>had the same subjects been painted upon a small scale, though equally
	well executed, they would have been less attractive to the multitude;
	yet the smaller ones would have reflected the same sized images in the
	camera of the eye; since, as I have already hinted, to see them properly
	they must be viewed at short distances, as the large pictures must be at
	greater proportionate ones.</p>


	<p>I will here digress for a moment, in the hope that I may be permitted
	to make mention of my own works, without incurring the charge of
	undue egotism. Let me, however, by way of apology for calling public
	attention to the series of forty small Water-Color Drawings, (painted
	<i>con amore</i>, and with no idea of gain,) which are now before the public,
	mention the fact, that the commencement of their publication was owing
	to a suggestion of Gen. <span class="special_name">Cass</span>, who urged me to undertake the enterprise
	while I was in Paris. The drawings then consisted of half the present
	number of landscape views; the localities and subjects of the latter
	half have been chosen with the purpose of writing appropriate chapters
	illustrating the progress of civilization and of refinement in the northern
	part of this continent. The foregoing brief remark applies only to their
	publication; for their <em>origin</em> dates back to the halcyon days of early
	life, when I had but just passed my teens; when boyish enthusiasm
	lends a charm to every dream that finds a home in the fancy or the
	heart. Then it was that the latent wish was formed of being able, at
	some future day, to paint the History of the Day; and to carry out this
	impulsive feeling, I have been brought into sweet communion with divine
	Nature; and oh! how bounteously has she repaid my studious contemplation
	with infinite delight! It is not for me to speak of the results.
	There they are; and every lover of the country may judge of the
	degree of success I have achieved. I am not so certain that I have
	equal ability in the use of the pen. The chapters of the first number
	will speak for themselves; but I must not omit to acknowledge the many
	obligations I am under to <span class="special_name">Washington Irving</span>, for the friendly revision
	of my ms. He has given many an elegant turn to a prose sentence,
	and clothed rude images with graceful drapery. But to resume.</p>


	<p>Since then it follows that a small picture, being viewed at its proper
	focal distance, reflects the same sized image as a larger one at <em>its</em> proper
	focal distance, I can see no good reason why the physical attribute of
	<em>largeness</em> should be so eagerly sought for by the public. Surely a gallery
	of small pictures, provided they be not painfully small, should be
	preferred to one filled with large ones. We see the principle I am contending
	for carried out in libraries. The ordinary sized volumes are
	preferred, for most purposes, to the cumbrous tomes of large folio editions.
	It is true, a large book will produce in the minds of many persons
	greater respect than a miniature copy of the same work; but the
	ideas contained in the one are no better or more impressive than the
	same contained in that of the other; save the feeling with which the
	larger one inspires the votary who looks no farther than the outside of
	the page. The series of forty landscapes alluded to in the above digression,
	if viewed at the focal distance of eighteen inches, will appear as
	large as those twice the size, viewed at their proportionate increased
	distance. An elaborately finished picture, to be seen to advantage,
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page159" name="page159"></a>159</span>must be examined near by. A coarser work, theatrical scenes for
	instance, painted for distant effect, must be seen accordingly, if you
	would secure pleasurable emotions. As a general approximative rule,
	the focal distance at which the spectator should stand in viewing works
	of art is to be found by measuring the same length from the picture as
	its size: Thus, one of ten feet in length is to be viewed at that distance;
	one of eighteen inches at about twenty inches; a small miniature of six
	inches, at about eight inches. If the work should have no detail, this
	rule will not hold good; but if there is a faithful transcript of Nature;
	and she ever delights in unobtrusive beauties, which are particularly
	obvious in the fore-ground, for she strews them at your feet; then if you
	approach the artist&#8217;s effort, a work of patient diligence, you can hold
	converse with her through the medium of his labors.</p>

	<p>I do not attempt to deny the importance of size in winning our first
	regard: it is a law inseparable from the thing itself; but I must protest
	against the taste of the age being supplied always with mere physical
	attributes. The purling stream and babbling brook; the small rill falling
	from on high, till its feathery stream is lost in mist, are and should
	be as much sought after as the roaring torrent or the thundering cascade.
	The effect of the one is to produce awe, that of the other tranquil pleasure.
	The human mind is not always to be upon the stretch; to remain
	lifted up as it were upon stilts; our common communion is to be found
	in enjoyments that are quietly exciting. It is a common remark, that
	the English language has lost some of its truthfulness by our habit of
	expressing ourselves in the language of superlatives, through a desire
	to astonish. Thus we leave nothing for the innate love of truth; nothing
	to work out the necessary sympathy. Is not this parallel with the
	desire to see large pictures?&#8212;and should it not receive some regulation
	from those who have the requisite influence?</p>

	<p>I find the few hints to which in the outset I proposed to confine myself
	have grown to a greater length than was intended. I will therefore,
	in closing, simply reiterate the remark, that I see no good reason
	why the painter of a large picture (or the work itself) should be regarded
	with more favor than he who paints equally well, but limits the size,
	unless we consider the white-wash brush a nobler instrument than the
	camel&#8217;s-hair pencil.</p>

	<p><span class="first_word">Wednesday</span>, June twenty-first. How little do people who ride along
	in their carriages, or rattle over the ground in stage-coaches, or rush
	over its surface in rail-cars, know of the pleasures of travelling! They
	roll <em>over</em> the country; they cannot be said to pass <em>through</em> it. They
	may see new rivers, new mountains, and new faces; but for all the
	good the last does them, they might as well have stood on the corner of
	the street in a city half a day, and watched the passers-by. And better
	too; for hotel-keepers, and waiters, and the whole tribe of public
	functionaries, have all an artificial, professional look; so that it is difficult
	to come at their real characters, if indeed they have any. The
	same is the case, to some extent, with their fellow-passengers. All are
	so absorbingly interested in their own brilliant thoughts; or they deem
	it incumbent on them to assume the dignity and authority befitting persons
	in high stations; (which dignity at home, by the by, is put one
	side into a dark corner and never thought of,) that it is about as profitable
	an undertaking to attempt to find out the personal feelings and sentiments
	of a mask, as theirs.</p>

	<p>But here am I, walking stoutly and merrily along, unincumbered
	with luggage or care; and because I do not care what the next day or
	hour may bring forth, every thing seems to turn up just as I would have
	it if I had the ordering of events. I shall not pause to offer any philosophical
	conjectures as to the reason why we are invariably disappointed
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page162" name="page162"></a>162</span>in our conclusions, (excepting they are mathematical ones) concerning
	the future; merely asking the amiable reader whether <em>he</em> ever knew such
	an anticipation to be exactly realized. I shall not stop to make any
	such conjectures, because I should only get deeper into the dark, and I
	am in deep enough for comfort now; and secondly, it is against my principles.
	I am living out of doors, and make mention only of things out
	of doors.</p>

	<p>But I trudge stoutly forward, whistling as I go; making myself as agreeable
	as possible to myself and to every body whom I meet; on jocose
	terms with every thing; decidedly agricultural in my tastes and pursuits,
	at every farmer&#8217;s house where I happen to put up for the night: at one
	place in search of employment as a day-laborer; at another, an artist;
	by turns every thing. Is not this the way to travel? My steps wander
	where they choose; and if I keep on to the end of the earth, what will it
	matter? I will go to the north; assume the dress, language and manners
	of those who dwell within the frozen circle; I will become a Greenlander;
	I will go and preach the religion of Mohammed to the inhabitants of
	Patagonia; I will brush up the gods of Rome; dust that old mythology;
	compound and simplify the whole into a good, comfortable, believable
	system, and proclaim Olympian Jove in the deserts of Amazonia. I
	will be a Turk, an Indian, a Pirate; I will be any thing. What do I
	care, and who shall say me nay? This sensation of freedom is too
	delicious to be interrupted by any companionship. And for my part, I
	want no better companions than this wind, which free as I am, blows
	against my cheek, and those clouds, that fly in unending succession over
	my head. O! ye blue chariots of the Thunderer! whither hurry ye
	so rapidly? Over hill and valley, and countries and cities of men, ye
	fly unheeding; and borne forward on the swift pinions of the wind, ye
	speed on your mission afar! What to you are states, and kingdoms, or
	land or ocean? Furiously driving in black armies to meet opposing
	armies, or singly floating in that waveless sea of blue, your existence
	is above the earth; men look <em>up</em> to you with wonder or terror, but <em>your</em>
	glance is never downward. Onward ye wander, in your unbounded
	career, at your own free will. Nothing bounds <em>my</em> career or <em>my</em> will.
	Fleecy ears! if ye would sustain the form of a mortal, triumphantly
	would you and I sail over the heads of men! Softly, obedient to the
	impulse of chance, would we glide over continent and sea, and explore
	the mysteries of undiscovered islands and climes; calmly would I look
	down on the strife or toil of human passions, and calmly would we ride
	on forever, through night and day! But if the clouds are not, the earth
	is, mine&#8212;and I am my own! There are none to molest or make me
	afraid with the useless importunities or warnings of friendship. My
	destiny is my own; and it is pleasant not to care what I may be or do.
	Pleasure is now; sorrow is prospective; and life will be only pleasure,
	because I let the past and the future go, and crowd as many happy
	thoughts as possible into the present moment.</p>

	<p>What a spacious plain of the world! Dotted with habitations and
	with men of all colors, and customs, and conditions! Every one thinks
	he possesses a soul; and in virtue thereof, he considers himself entitled
	to set up as an independent existence, and endeavors to move in a little
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page163" name="page163"></a>163</span>path of his own. But in fact, he plods humbly along, and repeats with
	patient toil the example of labor and unspeculating perseverance that
	his fathers have set him. A vast multitude, they darken the land!
	Mighty hopes and aspirations swell each small bosom. Each imagines
	that his designs are peculiar, and for him in particular was every thing
	mainly made. An unceasing rush of footsteps and clash of voices!
	And must I be confounded in the crowd? Let me preserve my individuality
	in the desert! If I were not an insect, it might be different; but
	as I am no larger than other men, I will not daily measure myself by
	their standard; I will forget in solitude the littleness of my stature.</p>

	<p>The shades of evening tinge the green of the fields with a darker
	hue; and the young farmer goes wearily and yet lightly homeward.
	Lightly, for he leaves behind him labor and trouble, and his fair-haired
	wife will greet him with her constant and love-lit smile. Cheerily will
	the small family draw around their board, covered with the simple and
	satisfying products of their own soil. And when all care is ended, when
	night is duskily stealing over the earth, he and his bride will sit down
	alone in their cottage door, in the red light of the western clouds.
	Over all the dim landscape there are no sights or sounds; and in themselves
	there are no feelings but those of contentment and love. In his
	strong palm her soft hand, on his broad breast reclining her head, their
	hearts are filled and overflow with sweet thoughts and gentle words of
	present happiness. Fair prospects also of the future rise up before them.
	Many years crowned with prosperity they see in store for them; and in
	each one, many an evening like this, of deep confiding love. Hour
	after hour, into the deepening night, their low tones and slow words murmur
	on brokenly; and they know of nothing in all the world that is
	wanting to their blessedness. What if the dream should last all their
	life? It may; or if this passes away, another will take its place. The
	question then seems to be, whether it is better to live in a delusion and
	be happy, or to wake and be miserable? Whether it is profitable for a
	man to walk joyfully through life, covering and coloring over every defect
	in human nature that he may love it, and keep within him a contented
	heart, or industriously spy out its deformities, and hate it and himself
	for possessing it? If nature is in reality naked and rugged, happy is
	he whose imagination can throw over her a robe of grace. Most happy
	he who <em>can</em> see in his fellow-creatures such qualities that he can love
	them. For me, I will love sterner scenes and sterner thoughts.
	Human beauty is an illusion; and it does not become the sober wisdom
	of manhood to be deceived by it. The young farmer and his young wife
	may be happy; and so may those who find delight in the crowded hall
	where taste and beauty meet; where are the sounds of clear-ringing,
	girlish voices, and many glancing feet, and the innumerable light of
	maiden&#8217;s eyes, and heavy folds of auburn hair, and the flush of thought
	and emotion continually passing over fair faces, with the swell of music
	that thrills, and the air laden with fragrance that intoxicates. Or in the
	still twilight, by the side of her whose every note makes his pulse to
	tremble with the breathing of song, and the incense of flowers, and forgetfulness
	of the world, to feel the thought stealing over his heart that
	perhaps he is not uncared for. It is sweet, but vain; sweet and vain
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page164" name="page164"></a>164</span>as the smiling, blushing slumber of a young girl. Dream on! dream
	on! for if you can always sleep, what will matter to you the storms and
	confusion without?</p>

	<p>But as for me, I cannot sleep. Every thing my eye rests on is harsh
	and ungraceful, because, having passed through the seven-times heated
	furnace, I <em>must</em> look through the covering and see the reality.</p>

	<h3 class="chapter_title">MOONLIGHT ON THE RIVER AND PRAIRIE.</h3>

	<p><span class="first_word">Wearily</span> I mount this steep eminence, and on its bald summit take
	off my hat, that I may feel the cool breeze. It comes fresh with the
	dew that it has snatched in its flight from the bosom of Lake Superior.
	It rolls over the tall grass of the prairie, which bends beneath its weight,
	sighs by me, and seems to cling to me as it passes, and moves on toward
	the arid plains of the South. The Ohio sweeps down in calmness and
	majesty. With its surface of quicksilver, and the little waves dancing
	up in gladness, and its heavy dull wash, it rolls along its mighty mass
	of waters, hastening to pour itself into the mightier mass of the Mississippi.
	Occasionally a giant tree, torn from its place, and cast root and
	branch into the flood, comes booming down, and glides swiftly past on
	its long, long race. Pleasantly the ripples break over the prostrate
	monarch of the forest that is lodged against the beach, and projects,
	branchless and barkless, into the stream; and mournfully the worn
	trunk sways up and down, as though tired of this rocking which has
	continued the same year after year; weary, and desiring to be at rest.
	Floods come rushing down upon floods with heavy tread, glance successively
	under the moonlight that is poured into the channel before me,
	and then are forced forward into the darkness of the future. But every
	wave seems as full of joy as though for it alone was the moonlight sent,
	and as though there were not unnumbered millions of waves to succeed
	it. Every little wave leaps up as it comes under the light, and smiles
	toward the round-faced orb above, who seems to smile back upon it.
	Thou small thing, thou art a fool! The queen, in the beam of whose
	countenance thou disportest thyself, is altogether deceitful and loves
	thee not. She has smiled as kindly on thousands who have gone before
	thee, and will upon thousands who shall come after thee. And more
	than all, she would send down just as bright and loving a glance, if
	thou and all thy race had never existed. How then canst thou say, &#8216;I
	love her,&#8217; or, &#8216;she loves me?&#8217;</p>

	<p>But perhaps it is not so. When I look again, each one of the great
	multitude appears aware of its own insignificance. Jostled, confined,
	crowded and confused, they go tumbling by, regardless of all above or
	below, and engrossed with their own fleeting existence. Not remembering
	whence they came, they take no thought of the present, and are
	utterly careless of the future. For what would it profit? Their business,
	and it is business enough, is to dispute and fight with each other
	for room to move in. All thoughts as to whither they are hastening,
	must be doubtful, angry and despairing; and care of any thing present,
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page165" name="page165"></a>165</span>except what concerns the present instant, would be useless. Therefore
	they resign themselves to be drawn onward and downward unresistingly;
	and therein are they wise. But whether joyful, or despairing, or not
	feeling at all, the waters roll by, an unceasing flood; and with their
	rushing dull roar in my ear, my eye rests on a scene of beauty and
	quietness. Far away to the northward and westward, and still farther
	away, stretches an immense plain. Rolling hillocks, like the waves of
	the sea after a storm, and at long intervals, a few stunted shrubs, alone
	diversify the prospect. Vast, unmeasured, Nature&#8217;s unenclosed meadow,
	the prairie, is spread out! The tall grass waves gently and rustlingly
	to the breeze; and down upon it settles the moonlight, in a dim silver-gossamer
	veil, like that which to the mind&#8217;s eye is thrown over the
	mountains and ruins and castles of the Old World, by the high-born
	daring and graces of chivalry, the wand of Genius, and the lapse of
	solemn years. With the same painful feeling of boundlessness, of vastness
	that will not be grasped by the imagination, that one feels in sailing
	on the ocean, there is also an air of still, stern desolation brooding upon
	the plain. It may be that at some former day, the punishment of fire
	swept over it, consuming its towering offspring, and laying bare and
	scorching its bosom; and now the proud sufferer, naked and chained,
	endures the summer&#8217;s heat and the winter&#8217;s storms, with no sighing
	herbage or wailing tree to tell to the winds its wo.</p>

	<p>A single snow-white cloud slumbers and floats far up in the heavens;
	the moon is gliding slowly down the western arch; and the vast dome,
	studded with innumerable brilliants, &#8216;fretted with golden fires,&#8217; rests its
	northern and western edge on the plain, its southern on blue mountain-tops,
	its eastern on the forests, and shuts us, the river, the prairie, the
	moon and I, together and alone. And here will we dwell together
	alone! Sweet companions will ye be to me; and standing here on this
	eminence, I promise to love you. I promise to come here often, and to
	hold communion with you. I will put away all thoughts of sorrow, all
	swellings of bitterness, from my mind. Contentedly, calmly, unheedingly,
	will we let the years pass by; for what will it matter to us? Oh!
	ye are dear to me! Your <em>voice</em> is not heard, yet comes there constantly
	to my ear the murmur of your song. You speak to me in music and
	poetry; and while I listen, my thoughts revert only with shuddering to
	the vain world I have left behind. Thus let us converse always. This
	vaulted firmament which shuts down upon us now, let it be immoveable,
	and enclose us forever; here let the wanderings of the wanderer cease,
	and here will we live together and alone!</p>

	<p class="post_break"><span class="first_word">And</span> we <em>have</em> lived here many years. The lessons of my constant
	companions have calmed and elevated me to a gentler and better spirit.
	From them I have learned humility as well as self-reliance; while from
	the history of the actions and thoughts of men in past ages, I have
	learned perhaps something of the machinery of human nature. The
	forms of the noblest of preceding generations, and the shapes of beauty
	which their imaginations have conceived and made to live, visit me at
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page166" name="page166"></a>166</span>my bidding. But among all the pictures that daily rise up before my
	eyes, the brightest, the most beautiful, the most loved, are the sweet
	faces of the friends of my early years. There are no regrets or repinings
	when I look back now; it must be that it has all been for the
	best, that every thing is for the best, and I am at peace. The recollection
	of madness and folly, of a life useless, of energies wasted, do not
	disturb the calmness of my soul. The error has been great, but I feel
	it; and in the next state of existence I shall be wiser and more active.
	If I have wantonly and recklessly turned away from the offered happiness
	of society and of the world, it has, in the end, been better for me,
	for I have found another, a purer and more lasting.</p>

	<p>Thus I look cheerfully on, and see the sands of my life run out.
	They fall faster and faster, as their number is diminished, and time
	flies by me with constantly accelerating speed. &#8216;Oh, my days are
	swifter than a weaver&#8217;s shuttle!&#8217;&#8212;the <em>last one</em> I see but a little distance
	before me; it will soon be here; and I shall step forth with a joyful,
	courageous heart, into the indistinct, dimly-revealed future!</p>

	<h2 class="title">THE PAINTED ROCK.</h2>
	<h3 class="byline">BY CHARLES F. POWELL.</h3>


	<p><span class="first_word">The</span> tract of country through which meanders the Tennessee river,
	for wild, sublime and picturesque scenery, is scarcely surpassed by any
	in the United States. This river was anciently called the Hogohege,
	and also Cherokee river: it takes its rise in the mountains of Virginia,
	in the thirty-seventh degree of latitude, and pursues a course of one
	thousand miles south and south-west nearly to the thirty-fourth degree of
	latitude, receiving from both sides large tributary streams. It then
	changes its direction to the north, circuitously winding until it mingles
	with the waters of the Ohio, sixty miles from its mouth. There is a
	place near the summit of the Cumberland mountains, which extends
	from the great Kenhawa to the Tennessee, where there is a very remarkable
	ledge of rocks, thirty miles in length and nearly two hundred
	feet high, showing a perpendicular face to the south-east, which for
	grandeur and magnificence surpass any fortification of art in the known
	world. It has been the modern hypothesis, that all the upper branches
	of the Tennessee formerly forced their way through this stupendous
	pile.</p>

	<p>On the Tennessee, about four hundred and fifty miles from its mouth,
	and nearly two hundred above what is called Muscle-Shoals, there is
	another ledge of rocks stretching along the shore to the extent of one
	mile, with a perpendicular front toward the river, of the most perfect
	regularity. This ledge varies in height from thirty to three hundred
	feet, being much the highest at the centre, and diminishing at each end
	into ragged cliffs of rock and broken land. This variegated surface extends
	for many miles, affording a constant succession of fanciful and
	romantic views. The whole rocky formation in this vicinity is composed
	of a light gray lime-stone, indented with broad dark lines formed by
	the dripping of the water which falls from the scanty covering of soil
	on the top to the deep channel below. The thin surface of soil sustains
	a shabby, stinted growth of fir, oak, and other trees, which seldom grow
	above the height of tall shrubbery. From the crevices of the rock also
	may occasionally be seen a tree of diminutive dimensions springing out
	with scarcely a particle of visible sustenance for its roots. The shrubbery
	upon the peak of this acclivity presents a curious appearance as it
	hangs over the ascent, not unlike the bushy eye-brows of a sullen and
	frowning face. With this ledge of rocks terminate the Cumberland
	mountains, which cross the State of Tennessee to the margin of the
	river. The stream here flows nearly west, through a beautiful valley of
	alluvial land, formed by the Cumberland mountains and a continuation
	of the Blue Ridge of Virginia. Immediately opposite the termination
	of the Cumberland mountains commences a broken and rocky surface,
	which extends along the shore of the river for many miles, presenting
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page168" name="page168"></a>168</span>the most varied and novel scenery in nature; while the other shore is
	level, fertile, and mostly in a high state of cultivation, abounding in verdant
	fields of meadow, corn and tobacco.</p>

	<p>The middle portion of the ledge <em>proper</em>, which I have described, rises
	nearly or quite three hundred feet above the level of the river; a vast
	wall of solid lime-stone, echoing with never-ceasing moans the gurgling
	current of the river, which at this place is deep and very rapid; and
	has worn a series of caves and hollows in the base of the rock, which
	contribute greatly to this &#8216;language of the waters.&#8217;</p>

	<p>The summit or peak of this ledge in the centre is called &#8216;<i>The Painted
	Rock</i>.&#8217; It is so called from the fact of there being, about sixty feet
	below the highest peak, letters and characters painted in different colors,
	and evidently drawn by a tutored hand. What is most remarkable,
	these paintings are upon the perpendicular face of the rock, probably two
	hundred feet above the river, and in a place where there is no apparent
	possibility for mortal man to arrive. They are composed of the initials
	of two persons, together with characters and drawings, some of which
	are illegible from the river. The first consists of the letters &#8216;J. W. H.,&#8217;
	quite well done in dark blue or green paint. The next is &#8216;A. L. S.,&#8217;
	done in red, and also a trefoil leaf of clover in green, beside several
	rude characters and drawings in blue and red. The traveller passing
	this interesting spot gazes with wonder and astonishment, but is referred
	to tradition for a history of the circumstances which led to the name
	of Painted Rock; for the paintings were drawn and the name given,
	long before the country was permanently settled by the whites. The
	story handed down is this:</p>

	<p>The original possessors of the soil in this part of the country were
	the tribes of Cherokee and Chicasaw Indians. The country was explored
	as early as 1745, by a company who had grants of land from the
	government, and settlements commenced previous to the French war.
	Of the first-comers of whites there were not more than sixty families,
	who were either destroyed or driven off before the end of the following
	year. Some few families had settled at a place not far distant from the
	Painted Rock, where lived a Cherokee Sagamore, named Shagewana,
	whose tribe was considered the most inhuman of any in the nation.
	The top of the rock is flat, and slopes back from the river, and at the
	base is a large spring surrounded by bushes. Shagewana occupied the
	summit of the acclivity as his council-ground; and when danger was
	apprehended from the whites, or when an innovation was made on his
	limits, he forthwith called his warriors together for consultation, and
	set fire to faggots and other combustibles as a signal for his neighbors
	to advance to his aid. The whites settled near the Painted Rock at
	this time were mostly composed of traders, who had brought various
	articles of clothing and ornaments to dispose of to the Indians; and
	under the assurance of the Chicasaws, who rarely commenced the work
	of destruction on the whites, that they should be unmolested, built up a
	cluster of huts, and cleared a small territory for the raising of corn and
	other vegetables.</p>

	<p>Shagewana from some cause became incensed toward them, and resolved
	to burn the buildings and destroy their inhabitants. He called
	his people together, and the war-cry was sounded throughout the mountains.
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page169" name="page169"></a>169</span>Taking advantage of the night, they surrounded the settlement,
	and applying torches to the dwellings, rushed into the midst with tomahawk
	in hand, and murdered all save two young men, who fought so
	bravely that they spared their lives in order to torture them with more
	prolonged sufferings. The names of these young men it is said were
	<span class="special_name">Harris</span> and <span class="special_name">Snelling</span>. They were bound and taken to the rock, where
	the savages went through a dance, as was their custom after a victory
	had been achieved; and as day-light advanced, they prepared a feast.
	Harris and Snelling were placed under keepers, who amused themselves
	by tormenting their unhappy prisoners in various ways; such as
	pricking them with their knives, cutting off small pieces of their ears
	and fingers, and pulling out clumps of their hair. Before the close of
	the day, the captives feigning sleep, the Indians left them for a moment
	and went to the spring for water. Thereupon the young men burst
	their bands and escaped into the bushes. Crawling upon the other side
	of the rock, and being hotly pursued, it is supposed that they were
	forced upon a narrow projection, about twelve inches wide, and four
	feet below the inscription, where with some paint or coloring substance
	which they carried about them they traced the characters to which we
	have referred, and which have given the place the name of &#8216;<span class="special_name">The
	Painted Rock</span>.&#8217; The fate of the young men is not positively known;
	but it is believed that they were discovered and hurled down the precipice.</p>

	through it all, and remained as a permanent specimen of unformed but most promising
	genius. Modest however as the offering was, it was duly valued by discerning judges, not
	so much for its own ripe excellence, as for its appearing a happy token of something else.
	In the major part of the annual soarings into <em>Cloud-land</em> which alarm the world, we seem
	to see the sum total of the aspirant&#8217;s power. We feel that he has shown us <em>all</em>, and done
	his best; that the force of his cleverness could go no farther; and we are willing to give
	him his penny of praise, and thereby purchase a pleasant oblivion of him and his forevermore.
	In this attempt of Mr. <span class="special_name">Lowell&#8217;s</span> it was impossible not to see that there lay more
	beyond. We felt that however boldly he might have dived, he did not yet &#8216;bring up the
	bottom,&#8217; as the swimmer&#8217;s phrase goes. The faults of his poems were perceptible enough,
	yet even these were the blemishes of latent strength, and the book was every where welcomed
	with a hope. We have now to notice the appearance of a second proof of Mr.
	<span class="special_name">Lowell&#8217;s</span> activity of faculty, in another and larger volume. It confirms the faith of those
	who read the former one. There is, throughout, the manifestation of growth; of a continuous
	advance toward a more decided character. Yet it is not without incompleteness
	of expression; it smacks of immaturity still; but it is the immaturity which presages a man.</p>

	<p>The longest, and although not the most pleasing, yet perhaps the best poem in the volume
	is the &#8216;Legend of Brittany,&#8217; a romantic story, fringed with rhyme. It contains but one
	bad line, and that one the first in the book: &#8216;Fair as a summer dream was <span class="special_name">Margaret</span>.&#8217;
	It is not only vague, but common-place: there is no particular reason that we know of
	why a summer dream should be fairer than a winter dream; and we cannot think that the
	poet meant to make use of that figure of speech called <i>amphibology</i>, although the line will
	bear a double interpretation. The legend is of the guilty amour of <span class="special_name">Mordred</span>, a Knight
	Templar, with a fair innocent who, upon the point of becoming a mother, is slain by her
	lover at evening, in the wood. <span class="keep_together">Hereupon&#8212;&#8212;</span> But let the poet speak:</p>


	<div class="poem">
	<div class="stanza">
	<p>His crime complete, scarce knowing what he did,</p>
	<p class="i2">(So goes the tale,) beneath the altar there</p>
	<p>In the high church the stiffening corpse he hid,</p>
	<p class="i2">And then, to &#8217;scape that suffocating air,</p>
	<p>Like a scared ghoule out of the porch he slid;</p>
	<p class="i2">But his strained eyes saw blood-spots everywhere,</p>
	<p>And ghastly faces thrust themselves between</p>
	<p>His soul and hopes of peace with blasting mien.</p>
	</div>
	</div>


	<p>It should be observed that Mordred, bound as a Templar by the strictest laws of chastity,
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page171" name="page171"></a>171</span>is aiming at the &#8216;high grand-mastership,&#8217; and consequently suffers not only the remorse of
	the murderer, but the dread of that defeat which his ambition must encounter in the discovery
	of his deed. His character is ably delineated; perhaps too nicely drawn, for so
	brief a tale, since the interest momentarily awakened in the &#8216;dark, proud man,&#8217;</p>


	<div class="poem">
	<div class="stanza">
	<p class="i6">&#8212;&#8212;&#8216;whose half-blown youth</p>
	<p>Had shed its blossoms even in opening,&#8217;</p>
	</div>
	</div>

	<p>is immediately lost in the horror of the catastrophe. But to pursue the outline of the
	story:</p>


	<div class="poem">
	<div class="stanza">
	<p>Now, on the second day, there was to be</p>
	<p class="i2">A festival in church: from far and near</p>
	<p>Came flocking in the sun-burnt peasantry,</p>
	<p class="i2">And knights and dames with stately antique cheer,</p>
	<p>Blazing with pomp, as if all faërie</p>
	<p class="i2">Had emptied her quaint halls, or, as it were,</p>
	<p>The illuminated marge of some old book,</p>
	<p>While we were gazing, life and motion took.</p>
	</div>

	<p class="poetry_break">&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;</p>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p>Then swelled the organ: up through choir and nave</p>
	<p class="i2">The music trembled with an inward thrill</p>
	<p>Of bliss at its own grandeur: wave on wave</p>
	<p class="i2">Its flood of mellow thunder rose, until</p>
	<p>The hushed air shivered with the throb it gave,</p>
	<p class="i2">Then, poising for a moment, it stood still,</p>
	<p>And sank and rose again, to burst in spray</p>
	<p class="i2">That wandered into silence far away.</p>
	</div>
	</div>

	<p>The whole of the description of this choir-service is equally beautiful with these stanzas;
	yet it may be objected that it in some degree impedes the progress of narration; and the
	tale is of that sort which will scarce brook any delay in the telling. But to continue.
	During the chanting, a breathless pause comes over the congregation; the music hushes;
	all eyes are drawn by some strange impulse toward the altar; and while all is mute and
	watchful, the voice of Margaret is heard from heaven, imploring a baptism for her unborn
	babe. The author himself cannot feel more sensibly than ourselves the injustice of thus
	patching together the beauteous fragments of his sorrowful and melodious history in so
	hugger-mugger a way; but <span class="special_name">Maga</span> is peremptory, and hints to us that we cannot command
	the scope of the &#8216;Edinburgh Review:&#8217; The voice ceases to thrill the wondering multitude,
	and the poet thus proceeds:</p>


	<div class="poem">
	<div class="stanza">
	<p>Then the pale priests, with ceremony due</p>
	<p class="i2">Baptized the child within its dreadful tomb,</p>
	<p>Beneath that mother&#8217;s heart, whose instinct true</p>
	<p class="i2">Star-like had battled down the triple gloom</p>
	<p>Of sorrow, love, and death: young maidens, too,</p>
	<p class="i2">Strewed the pale corpse with many a milk-white bloom,</p>
	<p>And parted the bright hair, and on the breast</p>
	<p>Crossed the unconscious hands in sign of rest.</p>
	</div>
	</div>

	<p>It is an indication of Mr. <span class="special_name">Lowell&#8217;s</span> capabilities for a more extended theme that the
	second part of this poem is superior to the first. It is not merely that the interest of the
	story increases, but the verse is more compressed, the expressions are more graphic, and
	the flow of the stanza is finer and more natural. The opening lines are as vivid and impressive
	as a passage from Tasso:</p>

	<div class="poem">
	<div class="stanza">
	<p>&#8216;As one who, from the sunshine and the green,</p>
	<p class="i2">Enters the solid darkness of a cave,</p>
	<p>Nor knows what precipice or pit unseen</p>
	<p class="i2">May yawn before him with its sudden grave,</p>
	<p>And, with hushed breath, doth often forward lean,</p>
	<p class="i2">Deeming he hears the plashing of a wave</p>
	<p>Dimly below, or feels a damper air</p>
	<p>From out some dreary chasm, he knows not where;</p>
	<p class="i2">So from the sunshine and the green of Love,</p>
	<p>We enter on our story&#8217;s darker part,&#8217; etc.</p>
	</div>
	</div>

	<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page172" name="page172"></a>172</span>The faults of the whole production are the necessary ones of all young writers of original
	power; a too ready faculty of imitation, and a lack of conciseness. The poets whom
	Mr. <span class="special_name">Lowell</span> mostly reminds us of, in his faults, are <span class="special_name">Shelly</span> and <span class="special_name">Shakspeare</span>; the juvenile
	<span class="special_name">Shakspeare</span>, we mean&#8212;<span class="special_name">Shakspeare</span> the sonnetteer. Both in the &#8216;Revolt of
	Islam&#8217; and &#8216;Tarquin and Lucrece,&#8217; blemishes resembling his own constantly occur. It
	will nevertheless be gratifying to his many ardent admirers to perceive that on the whole
	he has exhibited a more definite approach to what he is capable of accomplishing, and that
	in proportion as he has grown less vague and ethereal, less fond of personifying sounds and
	sentiments, so has he advanced toward a more manly and enduring standard of excellence.
	&#8216;Prometheus&#8217; is the next longest poem, and it has afforded us great gratification. It might
	almost be mistaken for the breath of <span class="special_name">Æschylus</span>, except that it contains sparkles of freedom
	that even the warm soul of the Greek could never have felt. The first two lines glitter
	with light:</p>


	<div class="poem">
	<div class="stanza">
	<p>&#8216;One after one the stars have risen and set,</p>
	<p>Sparkling upon the hoar-frost on my chain.&#8217;</p>
	</div>
	</div>

	<p>Although, rhyme is no tyrant to our poet, yet he seems to take a fuller swing when free
	from its influence; and the verse which he employs for the vehicle of his thoughts in this
	genuine poem is peculiarly adapted to the grandeur and dignity of his subject. This composition
	will stand the true test of poetry; a test which many immortal verses cannot abide,
	for it will bear translation into prose without loss of beauty or power: it contains more
	thoughts than lines, and although abounding in high poetic imaginings, the spirit of true
	philosophy which it contains is superior to the poetry.</p>

	<p>Of Mr. <span class="special_name">Lowell&#8217;s</span> shorter specimens we may remark, in contradistinction to what has
	been said of the Legend of Brittany, that so far as they resemble the <em>kind</em> of his former productions,
	so far in short as they are re-castings of himself, they do him injustice. We now
	feel that he is capable of stronger and loftier efforts, and are unwilling to overlook in his
	later compositions the flaws that are wilfully copied from his own volume. The public
	demand that he should go onward, and not wander back to dally among flowers that have
	been plucked before, and were then accepted for their freshness. He must devote himself
	to subjects of wider importance, and give his imaginations a more permanent foothold upon
	the hearts of men. His love-poems, though many of them would have added grace to his
	<em>first</em> collection, fail to excite our admiration <em>equally</em> in this. We do not say that he had exhausted
	panegyric before; far less would we insinuate that passion itself is exhaustible;
	and yet there is a point where to pause might be more graceful than to go on: &#8216;<i>Sunt certi
	denique fines.</i>&#8217; Did any one ever wish that even <span class="special_name">Petrarch</span> had written more? Mr.
	<span class="special_name">Lowell</span> then ought to consider this, and begin to build upon a broader foundation than his
	own territory, beautiful as it may be, of private and personal fancies and affections. Perhaps
	there is no exception to the law that love should always be the first impulse that leads
	an ardent soul to poesy. (By poesy we do not mean school-exercises, and prize heroics approved
	by a committee of literary gentlemen.) On this account, it may be, that a young
	poet is always anxious to walk upon the ground where he first felt his strength, considering
	that a minstrel without love were as powerless, to adopt the Rev. <span class="special_name">Sidney Smith&#8217;s</span> jocose
	but not altogether clerical illustration, as Sampson in a wig. Mr. <span class="special_name">Lowell</span> evinces the
	firmest faith in his passion, which is evidently as sincere as it is well-bestowed. It is from
	this perhaps that he derives a corresponding faith in his productions, which always seems
	proportionate to his love of his subject. Let him be assured however that he is not always
	the strongest when he feels the most so, nor must he mistake the absence of this feeling for
	a symptom of diminished power. Should he be at any time inclined to such a self-estimate,
	let him refer his judgment to his &#8216;Prometheus&#8217; and &#8216;Rhœcus.&#8217; In his &#8216;Ode&#8217; also,
	and his &#8216;Glance behind the Curtain,&#8217; there is much to embolden him toward the highest
	endeavors in what he would perhaps disdain to call his Art. Poesy, notwithstanding, <em>is</em>
	an <em>Art</em>, which even <span class="special_name">Horace</span> and <span class="special_name">Dryden</span> did not scorn to consider such; and our poet
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page173" name="page173"></a>173</span>ought to remember that he is bound not only to utter his own sentiments and fantasies according
	to his own impulse, but moreover to consult in some degree the ears of the world:
	the poet&#8217;s task is double; to speak <span class="small_all_caps">FROM</span> himself indeed, but <span class="small_all_caps">TO</span> the hearing of others.
	The contempt which a man of genius feels for the mere mechanicism of verse and rhyme
	may naturally enough lead him to affect an inattention to it; but in this he only benefits
	the school of smoother artists by allowing them at least <em>one</em> superiority. If he accuses them
	of being silly, they can retort that he is ugly.</p>
	<p>Our author in this second volume has given the small carpers who pick at the &#8216;eds&#8217; of
	past participles, and stickle for old-fashioned <em>moon</em>-shine instead of moon-<em>shine</em>, fewer causes
	of complaint. His diction is well-chosen and befitting his themes; and this is a characteristic
	which peculiarly marks the true artist, if it does not indicate the true genius. His
	execution, his &#8216;style of handling,&#8217; is adapted to his subject; an excellence in which too
	many artists, whether painters or poets, are sadly deficient. In this respect his performances
	and those of his friend <span class="special_name">Page</span> may be hung together. From the stately and dignified lines
	of &#8216;Prometheus&#8217; to the jetty, dripping verse of &#8216;The Fountain,&#8217; the step is very wide.
	How full of sparkling, brilliant effects are these joyous lines?</p>

	<p>Mr. <span class="special_name">Lowell</span> occasionally makes use of somewhat quaint, Spenserian expressions, but
	generally with peculiar effect. His abundant fancy seems to find its natural garb in the
	short and expressive phraseology of those old English writers of whom he manifests on all
	occasions so thorough an appreciation. As a sweet specimen, although a careless one, of
	his power of combining deep feeling with the most picturesque imagery, we select one of
	his lightest touches&#8212;&#8216;Forgetfulness:&#8217;</p>


	<div class="poem">
	<div class="stanza">
	<p><span class="first_word">There</span> is a haven of sure rest</p>

	<p>&#8216;The Shepherd of King Admetus&#8217; is exceedingly graceful and delicate, but it is too long
	to be quoted entire, and too perfect to be disjointed. We must reluctantly skip &#8216;Fatherland,&#8217;
	&#8216;The Inheritance,&#8217; &#8216;The Moon,&#8217; &#8216;Rhœcus,&#8217; and other favorites, until we come to
	&#8216;L&#8217;Envoi,&#8217; where our author once more throws his arms aloft, free from the incumbrance
	of rhyme. This poem is inscribed to &#8216;M. W.,&#8217; his heart&#8217;s idol. The warm affection which
	radiates from its lines, it is not to be mistaken, is an out-flowing of pure human love.
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page174" name="page174"></a>174</span>Among these personal feelings, touching which we have &#8216;said our say,&#8217; we find the following;
	which in <em>one</em> respect so forcibly illustrates what we have written within these two
	weeks to a western correspondent, that we cannot forbear to quote it here:</p>



	<div class="poem">
	<div class="stanza">
	<p><span class="first_word">Thou</span> art not of those niggard souls, who deem</p>
	<p>That poesy is but to jingle words,</p>
	<p>To string sweet sorrows for apologies</p>
	<p>To hide the barrenness of unfurnished hearts,</p>
	<p>To prate about the surfaces of things,</p>
	<p>And make more thread-bare what was quite worn out:</p>
	<p>Our common thoughts are deepest, and to give</p>
	<p>Such beauteous tones to these, as needs must take</p>
	<p>Men&#8217;s hearts their captives to the end of time,</p>
	<p>So that who hath not the choice gift of words</p>
	<p>Takes these into his soul, as welcome friends,</p>
	<p>To make sweet music of his joys and woes,</p>
	<p>And be all Beauty&#8217;s swift interpreter,</p>
	<p>Links of bright gold &#8217;twixt Nature and his heart</p>
	<p>This is the errand high of Poesy.</p>
	</div>

	<p class="poetry_break">&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;&middot;</p>

	<div class="stanza">
	<p>They tell us that our land was made for song,</p>
	<p>With its huge rivers and sky-piercing peaks,</p>
	<p>Its sea-like lakes and mighty cataracts,</p>
	<p>Its forests vast and hoar, and prairies wide,</p>
	<p>And mounds that tell of wondrous tribes extinct;</p>
	<p>But Poesy springs not from rocks and woods;</p>
	<p>Her womb and cradle are the human heart,</p>
	<p>And she can find a nobler theme for song</p>
	<p>In the most loathsome man that blasts the sight,</p>
	<p>Than in the broad expanse of sea and shore</p>
	<p>Between the frozen deserts of the poles.</p>
	<p>All nations have their message from on high,</p>
	<p>Each the messiah of some central thought,</p>
	<p>For the fulfilment and delight of Man:</p>
	<p>One has to teach that Labor is divine;</p>
	<p>Another, Freedom; and another, Mind;</p>
	<p>And all, that <span class="special_name">God</span> is open-eyed and just,</p>
	<p>The happy centre and calm heart of all.</p>
	</div>
	</div>

	<p>It is impossible to read such sentiments as these, without feeling our hearts open to him
	who gives them utterance. Mr. <span class="special_name">Lowell</span> is one of those writers who gain admiration for
	their verses and lovers for themselves. We can pay him no higher compliment.</p>

	<p>There is nothing in the title-page or appearance of this elegant volume to indicate that
	it is not published in Cambridge, England; but unlike the majority of American books of
	poetry, any page in the work will give out too strong an odor of Bunker-Hill, though we
	find no allusion to that sacred eminence, to allow the reader to remain long in doubt of its
	paternity. Although we hold that any writing worthy of being called poetry must be of universal
	acceptance, and adapted to the longings and necessities of the entire human family,
	as the same liquid element quenches the thirst of the inhabitants of the tropics and the
	poles, yet every age and every clime must of necessity tincture its own productions. We
	do not therefore diminish in the slightest degree the high poetical pretensions of Mr. <span class="special_name">Lowell&#8217;s</span>
	poems, when we claim for them a national character, silent though they be upon
	&#8216;the stars and stripes,&#8217; and a complexion which no other age of the world than our own
	could have given. They are not only American poems, but they are poems of the nineteenth
	century. There is a spirit of freedom, of love for <span class="special_name">God</span> and <span class="special_name">Man</span>, that broods over
	them, which our partiality for our own country makes us too ready perhaps to claim as
	the natural offspring of our land and laws. The volume is dedicated to <span class="special_name">William Page</span>,
	the painter, in a bit of as sweet and pure language as can be found in English prose. It
	might be tacked on to one of <span class="special_name">Dryden&#8217;s</span> dedications without creating an incongruous
	feeling. The dedication is as honorable to the poet as to the painter. Had all dedications
	been occasioned by such feelings as gave birth to this, these graceful and fitting tributes of
	affection and gratitude would never have dwindled away to the cold and scanty lines, like
	an epitaph on a charity tomb-stone, in which they appear, when they appear at all, in most
	modern books.</p>

	<div class="quotation">

	<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">I was</span> seated in the reading-room of the hotel, thinking away the half hour before dinner, when
	my attention was attracted by a singularly-looking man. He was dressed in a green coat, brass-buttoned
	close up to the neck, light gray, approaching to blue, elastic pantaloons, white cotton
	stockings, dress shoes, with more riband employed to fasten them than was either useful or ornamental;
	a hat, smaller than those usually worn, placed rather on one side of a head of dark curly
	hair; fine black eyes, and what altogether would have been pronounced a handsome face, but for an
	overpowering expression of impudence and vulgarity; a sort of footman-out-of-place-looking creature;
	his hands were thrust into the pockets of his coat behind, and in consequence exposing a portion
	of his person, as ridiculously, and perhaps as unconsciously, as a turkey-cock does when he intends
	to make himself very agreeable. He was walking rather fancifully up and down the room, partly
	singing, partly whistling &#8216;<i>The Bay of Biscay O</i>,&#8217; and at the long-lived, but most nonsensical chorus,
	he shook the fag-ends of his divided coat tail, as if in derision of that fatal &#8216;short sea,&#8217; so well known
	and despised in that salt-water burial-place. I was pretending to read a paper, when a carrier
	entered, and placed a play-bill before me on the table. I had taken it up and began perusing it, when
	he strutted up, and leaning over my shoulder, said:</p>

	<p>&#8216;&#8216;I beg pardon, Sir; just a moment.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;I put it toward him.</p>

	<p>&#8216;&#8216;No matter, Sir, no matter; I&#8217;ve seen all I want to see; the same old two-and-sixpence; <i>Hamlet,
	Mr. Sandford</i>, in large letters; <i>and Laertes, Mr. Vandenhoff</i>! <span class="keep_together">O&#8212;&#8212;!&#8217;</span></p>

	<p>&#8216;And with an epithet not in any way alluding to the &#8216;sweet South,&#8217; he stepped off to the <i>Biscay</i>
	tune, allegro. I was amused; and perhaps the expression of my face encouraged him to return
	instantly, and with the familiarity of an old acquaintance, for he said:</p>

	<p>&#8216;&#8216;My dear Sir, that&#8217;s the way the profession is going to the devil: here, Sir, is the &#8216;<em>manager</em>&#8217;&#8212;with
	a sneer&#8212;&#8216;one of the <span class="keep_together">d&#8212;&#8212;dest</span> humbugs that ever trod the stage, must have his name in large
	letters, of <em>course</em>; and the <em>and</em> Laertes, Mr. Vandenhoff; he&#8217;s a favorite of the Grand Mogul, as we
	call old Sandford, and so he gets all the fat; and d&#8217;ye know why he&#8217;s shoved down the people&#8217;s
	throats? Because he&#8217;s so <span class="keep_together">d&#8212;&#8212;d</span> bad the old man shows to advantage alongside of him. Did you
	ever see him?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;I shook my head.</p>

	<p>&#8216;&#8216;Why, Sir, he&#8217;s a tall, stooping, lantern-jawed, asthmatic-voiced, spindle-shanked fellow.&#8217; Here
	he put his foot on the rail of my chair, and slightly scratched the calf of his leg. &#8216;Hair the color of
	a cock-canary,&#8217; thrusting his fingers through his own coal-black ringlets; &#8216;with light blue eyes, Sir,
	trimmed with pink gymp. He hasn&#8217;t been long caught; just from some nunnery in Liverpool, or
	somewhere, where he was brought up as a Catholic priest; and here he comes, with his Latin and
	Lancashire dialect, to lick the manager&#8217;s great toe, and be hanged to him, and gets all the business;
	while men of talent, and nerve, and personal appearance,&#8217; shifting his hands from his coat-pockets to
	those of his tights, &#8216;who have drudged in the profession for years, are kept in the back-ground; &#8217;tis
	enough to make a fellow swear!&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;&#8216;You, then, Sir, are an actor?&#8217; said I, calmly.</p>

	<p>&#8216;&#8216;An actor! yes, Sir, I am an <em>actor</em>, and have been ever since I was an infant in arms; played the
	child that cries in the third act of the comedy of &#8216;The Chances,&#8217; when it was got up with splendor
	by Old Gerald, at Sheerness, when I was only nine weeks old; and I recollect, that is, my mother
	told me, that I cried louder, and more naturally, than any child they&#8217;d ever had. <em>That&#8217;s me</em>,&#8217; said
	he, pointing to the play-bill&#8212;<i>Horatio, Mr. Howard</i>. &#8216;I <em>used to make</em> a great part of Horatio <em>once</em>;
	and I can now send any Hamlet to <span class="keep_together">h-ll</span> in that character, when I give it energy and pathos; but this
	nine-tailed bashaw of a manager insists upon my keeping my &#8216;madness in the back-ground,&#8217; as he
	calls it, and so I just walk through it, speak the words, and make it a poor, spooney, preaching son of
	a how-came-ye-so, and do no more for it than the author has.&#8217;</p>

	<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page176" name="page176"></a>176</span>Mr. <span class="special_name">Cowell</span> subsequently enlists under the same manager, and is received with great

	any thing I have, is perfectly at your service,&#8217; was iterated by all. Howard said: &#8216;My

	Mr. <span class="special_name">Cowell</span>, it appears, was an artist of no mean pretensions; and while engaged on one
	occasion in sketching a picturesque view of Stoke Church, he was interrupted in rather a
	novel manner by a brother actor named <span class="special_name">Reymes</span>, somewhat akin, we fancy, to his friend
	<span class="special_name">Howard</span>, albeit &#8216;excellent company:&#8217;</p>

	<div class="quotation">

	<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">Several</span> times I was disturbed in my occupation, to look round to inquire the cause of a crash,
	every now and then, like the breaking of glass; and at length I caught a glimpse of Reymes, slyly
	jerking a pebble, under his arm, through one of the windows. I recollected twice, in walking home
	with him, late at night, from the theatre, his quietly taking a brick-bat from out of his coat-pocket
	and deliberately smashing it through the casement of the Town Hall, and walking on and continuing
	his conversation as if nothing had happened. Crack! again. I began to suspect an abberration of
	intellect, and said:</p>

	<p>&#8216;&#8216;Reymes, for heaven&#8217;s sake what are you doing?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;&#8216;Showing my gratitude,&#8217; said he; and crack! went another.</p>

	<p>&#8216;&#8216;Showing the devil!&#8217; said I; &#8216;you&#8217;re breaking the church windows.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;&#8216;Why, I know it&#8212;certainly; what do you stare at?&#8217; said the eccentric. &#8216;I broke nearly every
	pane three weeks ago; I couldn&#8217;t hit them all. After you have broken a good many, the stones are
	apt to go through the holes you&#8217;ve already made. They only finished mending them the day
	before yesterday; I came out and asked the men when they were likely to get done;&#8217; and clatter!
	clatter! went another.</p>

	<p>&#8216;&#8216;That&#8217;s excellent!&#8217; said he, in great glee. &#8216;I hit the frame just in the right place; I knocked out
	two large ones that time.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;&#8216;Reymes,&#8217; said I, with temper, &#8216;if you don&#8217;t desist, I must leave off my drawing.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;&#8216;Well,&#8217; said he, &#8216;only this one,&#8217; and crack! it went; &#8216;there! I&#8217;ve done. Since it annoys you, I&#8217;ll
	come by myself to-morrow and finish the job; it&#8217;s the only means in my power of proving my
	gratitude.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;&#8216;Proving your folly,&#8217; said I. &#8216;Why, Reymes, you must be out of your senses.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;&#8216;Why, did I never tell you?&#8217; said he. &#8216;Oh! then I don&#8217;t wonder at your surprise. I thought I
	had told you. I had an uncle, a glazier, who died, and left me twenty pounds, and this mourning-ring;
	and I therefore have made it a rule to break the windows of all public places ever since. The
	loss is not worth speaking of to the parish, and puts a nice bit of money in the pocket of some poor
	dealer in putty, with probably a large family to support. And now I&#8217;ve explained, I presume you
	have no objection to my proceeding in paying what I consider a debt of gratitude due to my dead
	uncle.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;&#8216;Hold! Reymes,&#8217; said I, as he was picking up a pebble. &#8216;How do you know but the poor fellow
	with the large family may not undertake to repair the windows by contract, at so much a year or
	month?&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;&#8216;Eh! egad, I never thought of that,&#8217; said the whimsical, good-hearted creature. &#8216;I&#8217;ll suspend
	operations until I&#8217;ve made the inquiry, and if I&#8217;ve wronged him I&#8217;ll make amends.&#8217;</p>

	<p>Mr. <span class="special_name">Cowell</span> is a plain-spoken man, and seldom spares age or sex in his exposure of the
	secrets of the stage, and the appliances and means to boot which are sometimes adopted
	by theatrical men and women to make an old face or form &#8216;look maist as weel&#8217;s the new.&#8217;
	The celebrated Mrs. <span class="special_name">Jordan</span>, in performing with him, was always very averse to his playing
	near the foot-lights, greatly preferring to act between the second entrances. The &#8216;moving
	why&#8217; is thus explained:</p>

	<div class="quotation">

	<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">The</span> fact is, she was getting old; dimples turn to crinkles after long use; beside, she wore a wig
	glued on; and in the heat of acting&#8212;for she was always in earnest&#8212;I have seen some of the tenacious
	compound with which it was secured trickle down a wrinkle behind her ear; her person, too,
	was extremely round and large, though still retaining something of the outline of its former grace:</p>


	<div class="poem">
	<div class="stanza">
	<p>&#8216;And after all, &#8217;twould puzzle to say where</p>
	<p>It would not spoil a charm to pare.&#8217;</p>
	</div>
	</div>

	<p><span class="first_word">There</span> is no calamity in the catalogue of ills &#8216;that flesh is heir to&#8217; so horrible as the approach of old
	age to an actor. Juvenile tragedy, light comedy, and walking gentleman with little pot-bellies, and
	<em>have-been</em> pretty women, are really to be pitied. Fancy a lady, who has had quires of sonnets made
	to her eye-brow, being obliged, at last, to black it, play at the back of the stage at night, sit with her
	back to the window in a shady part of the green-room in the morning, and keep on her bonnet unless
	she can afford a very natural wig.&#8217;</p>
	</div>


	<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page177" name="page177"></a>177</span>Sad enough! sad enough! certainly, and as true as it is melancholy. But let us get on
	board the Yankee vessel which brings Mr. <span class="special_name">Cowell</span> to America, and at <em>his</em> &#8216;present writing&#8217;
	is lying off Gravesend. The difficulty he experienced in getting up a conversation
	with his fellow-passengers is a grievance still loudly complained of by his travelling countrymen:</p>

	<div class="quotation">

	<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">It</span> was a dark, drizzly, melancholy night; a fair specimen of Gravesend weather and the parts adjacent;
	no &#8216;star that&#8217;s westward from the pole&#8217; to point my destined path, and furnish food for speculative
	thought; and, after sliding five or six times up and down some twenty feet of wet deck, I
	groped my way to the cabin. The captain was not on board, and I found myself a stranger among
	men. Of all gregarious animals man is the most tardy in getting acquainted: meet them for the first
	time in a jury-box, a stage-coach, or the cabin of a ship, and they always remind me of a little lot of
	specimen sheep from different flocks, put together for the first time in the same pen; they walk about
	and round and round, with all their heads and tails in different directions, and not a baa! escapes them;
	but in half an hour some crooked-pated bell-wether perhaps, gives a south-down a little dig in the
	ribs, and this example is followed by a Merino; and before the ending of the fair their heads are all one
	way, and you&#8217;ll find them bleating together in full chorus. Now, in the case of man, a snuff-box instead
	of the sheep&#8217;s horn, is an admirable introduction; for, if he refuses to take a pinch, he&#8217;ll generally
	give you a sufficient reason why he does not, and that&#8217;s an excellent chance to form, perhaps, a
	lasting friendship, but to scrape an acquaintance to a certainty; and if he takes it perhaps he&#8217;ll sneeze,
	and you can come in with your &#8216;God bless you!&#8217; and so on, to a conversation about the plague in &#8217;66,
	or the yellow fever on some other occasion, and can &#8216;bury your friends by dozens,&#8217; and &#8216;escape yourself
	by a miracle,&#8217; very pleasantly for half an hour. But in this instance it was a total failure: one said
	&#8216;I don&#8217;t use it;&#8217; another shook his head, and the third emptied his mouth of half a pint of spittle, and
	said &#8216;he thought it bad enough to chaw!&#8217;&#8217;</p>
	</div>

	<p>When the vessel is fairly at sea, the social ice is gradually broken. It being just after
	the war, the <i>rationale</i> of the following brief dialogue between Mr. <span class="special_name">Cowell</span> and the mate
	will be readily understood:</p>

	<div class="quotation">
		<p>&#8216;The mate was a weather-beaten, humorous &#8216;sea-monster;&#8217; upon asking his name, he replied:</p>
		<p>&#8216;&#8216;If you&#8217;re an Englishman and I once tell you my name, you&#8217;ll never forget it.&#8217;</p>
		<p>&#8216;&#8216;I don&#8217;t know that,&#8217; I replied; &#8216;I&#8217;m very unfortunate in remembering names.&#8217;</p>
		<p>&#8216;&#8216;Oh, never mind!&#8217; said he, with a peculiarly sly, comical look; &#8216;if you&#8217;re an Englishman you&#8217;ll
		never forget mine.&#8217;</p>
		<p>&#8216;&#8216;Then I certainly am,&#8217; I replied.</p>
		<p>&#8216;&#8216;Well, then,&#8217; said he drily, &#8216;my name&#8217;s <span class="special_name">Bunker</span>! and I&#8217;m <span class="keep_together">d&#8212;&#8212;d</span> if any Englishman will ever forget

	<p>Mr. <span class="special_name">Cowell&#8217;s</span> arrival, début, and theatrical progress and associations in this and other
	Atlantic towns, compose a diversified and palatable feast for the stage-loving public. His
	sketches of actors, male and female, native and foreign, are limned with an artistical hand.
	His picture of <span class="special_name">Kean&#8217;s</span> fleeing from &#8216;the hot pursuit of obloquy&#8217; is exceedingly vivid; and
	&#8216;old <span class="special_name">Mathews&#8217;</span> American &#8216;trip&#8217; is well set forth. We find nothing so good, however,
	touching that extraordinary mime, as the following illustration of his sensitiveness to newspaper
	criticism, from the pen of the dramatic veteran, <span class="special_name">Moncrief</span>:</p>

	<div class="quotation">

	<p>&#8216;&#8216;<span class="first_word">Look</span> here,&#8217; he would say, taking up a paper and reading: &#8216;Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.&#8212;We
	last night visited this elegant theatre for the purpose of witnessing the performance of that excellent
	comedian, Mr. <span class="special_name">Belvi</span>, as <i>Octavian</i>, in the &#8216;Mountaineers,&#8217; for his own benefit. We hope it was
	for his own benefit, for it certainly was not for the benefit of any one else; for a more execrable performance
	we never witnessed. This gentleman had better stick to his comedy!&#8217; Grant me patience;
	Heaven! There&#8217;s a fellow! What does he know about it? I suppose he would abuse my <i>Iago</i>&#8212;say
	that is execrable! Isn&#8217;t this sufficient to drive any body mad? Because a man happens to have
	played comedy all his life, &#8216;<em>we</em>&#8217; takes upon himself to think as a matter of course he can&#8217;t play tragedy,
	though he may possess first rate tragic powers, as I do myself! I should have been the best <i>Hamlet</i>
	on the stage if I didn&#8217;t limp; but let me go on: &#8216;We have seen <span class="special_name">Elliston</span> in the character.&#8217; A charlatan,
	a mountebank; wouldn&#8217;t have me at Drury; and yet &#8216;<em>we</em>&#8217; thinks he has a syllable the advantage
	of his competitor in this instance. We! we! as if the fellow had a parcel of pigs in his inside;
	<em>we! we!</em> Who&#8217;s <em>we</em>? Why don&#8217;t he say Tompkins, or whatever his name is, Tompkins thinks
	Elliston better in <i>Octavian</i> than Belvi; Belvi could kick Tompkins then; but who can kick <em>we</em>?&#8217;
	etc., etc. And yet poor Mathews had no warmer admirers, no truer, no more constant friends than
	those whose occasional animadversions would thus excite his ire.&#8217;</p>

	<p>After running a very successful and popular career at the Park-Theatre, our artist-actor
	is induced to assume the management of a circus-theatre just then in high vogue at the
	<span class="special_name">Tattersall&#8217;s</span> building in Broadway. The subjoined was one of the many incidents
	which occurred on his assuming the reins of the establishment:</p>

	<div class="quotation">
	<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">The</span> company was both extensive and excellent; a stud of thirty-three horses, four ponies
	and a jack-ass, all so admirably selected and educated, that for beauty and utility they could
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page178" name="page178"></a>178</span>not be equalled any where. The company was popular and our success enormous. Of course,
	like others when first placed in power, I made a total change in my cabinet. <span class="special_name">John Blake</span>
	I appointed secretary of the treasury and principal ticket-seller; and to prove how excellent
	a judge I was of integrity and capacity, he was engaged at the Park at the end of the season, and
	has held that important situation there ever since. A delicious specimen of the Emerald Isle, with
	the appropriate equestrian appellation of Billy Rider, received an office of nearly equal trust, though
	smaller chance of perquisites&#8212;stage and stable door-keeper at night, and through the day a variety
	of duties, to designate half of which would occupy a chapter. He was strict to a fault in the discharge
	of his duty, as every urchin of that day who attempted to sneak into the circus can testify.
	Conway the tragedian called to see me one evening, and in attempting to pass was stopped by Billy,
	armed as usual, with a pitch-fork.</p>

	<p>&#8216;&#8216;What&#8217;s this you want? Who are ye? and where are you going?&#8217; says Billy.</p>

	<p>&#8216;I wish to see Mr. Cowell,&#8217; says Conway.</p>

	<p>&#8216;Oh then, it&#8217;s till to-morrow at ten o&#8217;clock, in his office, that you&#8217;ll have to wait to perform that
	operation.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;But, my dear fellow, my name is Conway, of the theatre; Mr. Cowell is my particular friend, and
	I have his permission to enter.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;By my word, Sir, I thank ye kindly for the explination; and it&#8217;s a mighty tall, good-looking gentleman
	you are too,&#8217; says Billy, presenting his pitch-fork; &#8216;but if ye were the blessed Redeemer,
	with the cross under your arm, you couldn&#8217;t pass me without an orther from Mr. Cowell.&#8217;</p>

	Physiologie&#8217; of <span class="special_name">Magendie</span>. Translated, enlarged, and illustrated with Diagrams and Cuts, by
	Prof. <span class="special_name">John Revere</span>, M. D., of the University of New-York. In one volume. pp. 533. New-York:
	<span class="special_name">Harper and Brothers</span>.</p>

	<p><span class="first_word">The</span> American translator and editor of the volume above cited is of opinion that since
	the death of Sir <span class="special_name">Charles Bell</span>, there is no physiologist who stands so preëminent as an
	original observer and inquirer, or who has contributed so much to the present improved
	state of the science by his individual efforts, as M. <span class="special_name">Magendie</span>. In facility in experimenting
	upon living animals, and extended opportunities of observation, no one has surpassed
	him; while through a long professional career his attention has been chiefly devoted to
	physiological inquiries. There is one excellence which constitutes a predominant feature
	in his system of Physiology that cannot be estimated too highly by the student of medicine;
	and that is, the severe system of induction that he has pursued, excluding those imaginative
	and speculative views which rather belong to metaphysics than physiology. The work is
	also remarkable for the conciseness and perspicuity of its style, the clearness of its descriptions,
	and the admirable arrangement of its matter. The present is a translation of the
	fifth and last edition of the &#8216;<i>Précis Elémentaire de Physiologie</i>,&#8217; in which the science is
	brought down to the present time. It is not, like many modern systems, merely eclectic, or
	a compilation of the experiments and doctrines of others. On the contrary, all the important
	questions discussed, if not originally proposed and investigated by the author, have
	been thoroughly examined and experimented upon by him. His observations, therefore,
	on all these important subjects, carry with them great interest and weight derived from
	these investigations. The translator and editor, while faithfully adhering to the spirit of
	the author, has endeavored, and with success, to strip the work of its foreign costume, and
	<em>naturalize</em> it to our language. He has added a large number of diagrams and pictorial
	illustrations of the different organs and structures, taken from the highest and most recent
	authorities, in the hope of rendering clearer to the student of medicine the observations
	and reasonings on their functions. He has also made a number of additions on subjects
	which he thought had been passed over in too general a manner in the original work of
	<span class="special_name">Magendie</span>. In a word, his aim &#8216;to present a system of human physiology which shall exhibit
	in a clear and intelligible manner the actual state of the science, and adapted to the
	use of students of medicine in the United States,&#8217; has been thoroughly carried out.</p>

	<p><span class="first_word">The</span> distinguished clergyman who introduces this excellent book to American readers
	does it no more than justice when he declares it to be the work of a highly gifted mind,
	containing many beautiful philosophical views of the relation which woman sustains in
	society, abounding in the results of careful observation, and characterized by a pervading
	religious spirit. It is adapted to accomplish great good, and its circulation would do much
	to aid those who have the care of youthful females, and who desire that they should fill the
	place in society for which they were designed. There is no work in our language which
	occupies the place that this is intended to fill; nor which presents so interesting a view of
	the organization of society by its great <span class="special_name">Author</span>, and of the situation appropriated to <em>woman</em>
	in that organization. The book has reference more particularly to the elevated circles of
	society; to those who have advantages for education; who have leisure for the cultivation
	of the intellect and the heart after the usual course of education is completed, and who
	have opportunities of doing good to others. &#8216;It will supply a place which is not filled now,
	and would be eminently useful to that increasing number of individuals in our country.
	It is much to be regretted that not a few when they leave school seem to contemplate little
	farther advancement in the studies in which they have been engaged. A just view of the
	place which woman is designed to occupy in society, as presented in this volume, would do
	much to correct this error. We should regard it as an auspicious omen, if this work should
	have an extensive circulation in this country, and believe that wherever it is perused it
	will contribute to the elevation of the sex; to promote large views of the benevolence and
	wisdom of the Creator in regard to the human family, and to advance the interests of
	true religion.&#8217;</p>

	<p><span class="first_word">The</span> number of this publication for the December quarter is a very good one. We were
	especially interested in the &#8216;Michael Agonistes&#8217; of Mr. <span class="special_name">J. W. Brown</span>, which is, in parts,
	both powerful and harmonious, and in a dissertation upon &#8216;<span class="special_name">Weir&#8217;s</span> National Painting.&#8217;
	The writer is of opinion that our eminent artist has made a sad mistake in the conception
	of his striking group, although he awards warm praise to certain portions of the picture.
	Still he says: &#8216;It argues slight knowledge of human nature to suppose that melancholy
	resignation characterized those who at Delft-Haven embarked for a land of civil and religious
	liberty; wild and inhospitable, to be sure, but still a land of Freedom. There
	were other thoughts in the hearts of that noble band than those of sorrow. Even had they
	been leaving the country of their birth, they would not have sorrowed; but as it was,
	bidding farewell to a land of foreigners, almost as hostile to freedom as their own, they
	felt not otherwise than joyful, and their bosoms were full of thoughtful, reasoning gladness.
	The parting kiss of that young wife must have tried, somewhat, the firmness of her husband,
	yet not enough to cloud his bright anticipations of the future. A different mood
	than that imagined by Mr. <span class="special_name">Weir</span> should have pervaded the group, if we are not widely
	in error. &#8216;With all its faults,&#8217; adds our critic, however, &#8216;The Embarkation of the Pilgrims,&#8217;
	although not indicative of great genius, yet regarded as to execution, does honor
	to Mr. <span class="special_name">Weir</span>. We should do injustice to the central group, did we omit to confess that the
	devotional grandeur of the face of the minister, raised to heaven in prayer, struck us with a
	feeling of awe, such as we had perhaps never before experienced.&#8217; This especial tribute
	we have heard paid to this picture by every person whom we have heard refer to it.</p>

	<div class="ed_table_item">


	<p><span class="ed_table_title">American Manners and American
	Literature.</span>&#8212;We ask the attention of every right-minded American to the
	following remarks, which we take the liberty of transcribing from a welcome
	epistle to the Editor, from one of our most esteemed and popular contributors.
	The follies which it exposes and the evils which it laments have heretofore
	formed the themes of papers in this Magazine from the pens of able
	correspondents, as well as of occasional comment in our own departments; but we
	do not remember to have seen the subject more felicitously handled than by our
	friend: &#8216;The crying vice of the nation, and the one which of all others most
	fastens the charge of inconsistency on our character and professions, is that
	apish spirit with which we admire and copy every thing of European growth. While
	we exalt our institutions, character and condition over those of all other
	nations, and give ourselves &#8216;a name above every name,&#8217; is it not supremely
	absurd for city to vie with city and family with family in adopting the latest
	fashions in dress and opinions originating in nations which have grown old in
	profligacy, and abound in the worthless excrescences of society? We profess to
	be perfectly independent of all control in our thoughts and actions: &#8216;<i>Nullius
	addicti jurare in verba magistri</i>.&#8217; Yet who more readily than we shout in chorus
	to the newest modes of thinking ushered into ephemeral life by philosophers
	across the water? Who adopt so early or carry so far the most outre and
	preposterous styles of dress invented in Paris, as our American belles and
	dandies? The newest cut in garments which was hatched in Paris beneath the
	crescent-moon, her waning rays see carried to its utmost verge in our bustling
	marts. We follow the revolutions in the configuration of coats, from square to
	round, and from round to angular, with as scrupulous and painful a precision as
	if our national honor depended on the issue. Nay, we are usually a little <em>too</em>
	faithful, and fairly &#8216;out-Herod Herod.&#8217; Does the cockney of the &#8216;world&#8217;s
	metropolis&#8217; compress his toes in boots tapering at an angle of forty degrees?
	The republican fop promenades Broadway with <em>his</em> pedal extremities squeezed
	into an angle of thirty; and the corns ensuing he bears with christian
	fortitude; for does he not find his &#8216;exceeding great reward&#8217; in being more
	fashionable than the Londoner himself? Has the fat of the Siberian bear, or
	&#8216;thine incomparable oil, Macassar&#8217; called forth a thicket of hair on the cheek
	of the Frenchman, reaching from the cerebral pulse to the submaxillary bone?
	Instantly the pews of our churches, the boxes of our theatres, and the seats of
	our legislative halls, are thronged with whey-faced apes, the moisture of whose
	brains has exuded in nourishing a frowning hedge, of which the dark luxuriance
	encircles the whole face, resembling the old pictures of the saints wherewith
	our childhood was amused, encompassed with a glory! When the whiskered
	&#8216;petit-mâitres&#8217; of Hyde-Park shall begin to transport their adorable persons to
	this new world on a summer&#8217;s trip, they will be astonished not a little to be
	stared at on landing through opera-glasses by counterparts of themselves; exact
	to the last hair of the moustache. &#8216;Werily,&#8217; will be their ejaculation, &#8216;hit his
	wery great presumption in these wulgar democrats to himitate us Henglish in this
	way-ah!&#8217; Every <span class="pagenum"><a id="page181"
	name="page181"></a>181</span>easterly wind blows in a fleet laden with cargoes
	of folly, and every outward-bound vessel bears an order for fresh importations
	of absurdity, of which milliners and tailors are the shippers, and flirts and
	fops the consignees. So far has this mimicking spirit proceeded, that we regard
	neither climate nor season. Were some accident to delay for a few months our
	advices from Europe, I question not but our fashionable ladies would adopt in
	mid-winter the same form and materials for their dresses which the Parisian
	damsels sported on the Boulevards beneath the scorching dog-star. The changeful
	and chilly atmosphere of our sea-board differs widely from the genial airs of
	&#8216;La belle France,&#8217; and to adopt their fashions in detail is about as wise and
	tasteful in us as it would be for the negro panting beneath the line to wrap
	himself in the furs of Siberia, and substitute for his refreshing palm-juice the
	usquebaugh of the Highlands. Who would not laugh himself into a pleurisy to see
	the dandies of Timbuctoo stalking along in solemn gravity beneath their torrid
	sun, encumbered with a Russian fur-cloak, or a Lapland &#8216;whip&#8217; on a snow-sledge,
	driving his canine four-in-hand, with a Turkish turban and Grecian robe folded
	carelessly around him? Yet wherein do we greatly differ in <em>our</em> absurdities!
	Again: we profess to have lopped from our democratic tree the old-world customs
	of hereditary title and patrimonial honor. <em>We</em> are no respecters of persons.
	<em>We</em> have no reverence for ancestral virtues, and the lustre that shines only by
	reflection has no charms for <em>us</em>. <em>We</em> respect no grandees but &#8216;nature&#8217;s
	noblemen.&#8217; <em>We</em> look through the glittering atmosphere of place, and title, and
	factitious distinction, at the man himself. The artificer of his own fortunes we
	hail as a brother. He who possesses superior abilities or unblemished integrity,
	<em>we</em> honor, though his hands be on the plough; and he who is imbecile or
	dishonest, <em>we</em> despise, though his brow be encircled by a coronet. All noble,
	consistent, rational, and right. But how is this? &#8216;Lo! a foreigner has landed on
	our shores.&#8217; Well; what then? We also should be foreigners in Europe. &#8216;Yes; but
	he bears the honorable appendage of Lord, or Sir, or De, or Di, or Von, or Don.&#8217;
	Happy, meanwhile, thrice happy the youth whom his titleship will allow to treat
	him; blessed, triumphantly blessed, the Miss whose charms have warmed into life
	the cold gaze of my Lord Highbred, or Monsieur De Nonchalance. And oh! beatified
	beyond all rapture the doting mother, who in her ripened and expanded miniature
	begins to realize her dreams of &#8216;young romance,&#8217; and to hope by connection with
	a family more lineally descended from Adam than her own, to obtain a rank</p>

	<p>Truth, every word truth&#8212;satire most justly bestowed; and before relinquishing
	this general theme, let us ask the reader to admire with us the cognate remarks
	of a writer in the last number of the &#8216;North-American Review&#8217; upon the
	importance of a <em>Literature</em> which shall be distinctive and national in its
	character, and not a <i>rifacamento</i> of the varying literatures of various
	nations: &#8216;The man whose heart is capable of any patriotic emotion, who feels his
	pulse quicken when the idea of his country is brought home to him, must desire
	that country to possess a voice more majestic than the roar of party, and more
	potent than the whine of sects; a voice which should breathe energy and awaken
	hope where-ever its kindling tones are heard. The life of our native land; the
	inner spirit which animates its institutions; the new ideas and principles, of
	which it is the representative; these every patriot must wish to behold
	reflected from the broad mirror of a comprehensive and soul-animating
	literature. The true vitality of a nation is not seen in the triumphs of its
	industry, the extent of its conquests, or the reach of its empire; but in its
	intellectual dominion. Posterity passes over statistical tables of trade and
	population, to search for the records of the mind and heart. It is of little
	moment how many millions of men were included at any time under the name of one
	people, if they have left no intellectual testimonials of their mode and manner
	of existence, no &#8216;foot-prints on the sands of time.&#8217; The heart refuses to glow
	at the most astounding array of figures. A nation lives only through its
	literature, and its mental life is immortal. And if we have a literature, it
	should be a <span class="pagenum"><a id="page182"
	name="page182"></a>182</span><em>national</em> literature; no feeble or sonorous echo
	of Germany or England, but essentially American in its tone and object. No
	matter how meritorious a composition may be, as long as any foreign nation can
	say that it has done the same thing better, so long shall we be spoken of with
	contempt, or in a spirit of benevolent patronage. We begin to sicken of the
	custom, now so common, of presenting even our best poems to the attention of
	foreigners, with a deprecating, apologetic air; as if their acceptance of the
	offering, with a few soft and silky compliments, would be an act of kindness
	demanding our warmest acknowledgments. If the Quarterly Review or Blackwood&#8217;s
	Magazine speaks well of an American production, we think that we can praise it
	ourselves, without incurring the reproach of bad taste. The folly we yearly
	practise, of flying into passion with some inferior English writer, who
	caricatures our faults, and tells dull jokes about his tour through the land,
	has only the effect to exalt an insignificant scribbler into notoriety, and give
	a nominal value to his recorded impertinence. If the mind and heart of the
	country had its due expression, if its life had taken form in a literature
	worthy of itself, we should pay little regard to the childish tattling of a pert
	coxcomb who was discontented with our taverns, or the execrations of some bluff
	sea-captain who was shocked with our manners. The uneasy sense we have of
	something in our national existence which has not yet been fitly expressed,
	gives poignancy to the least ridicule launched at faults and follies which lie
	on the superficies of our life. Every person feels, that a book which condemns
	the country for its peculiarities of manners and customs, does not pierce into
	the heart of the matter, and is essentially worthless. If Bishop <span
	class="special_name">Berkeley</span>, when he visited <span
	class="special_name">Malebranche</span>, had paid exclusive attention to the
	habitation, raiment, and manners of the man, and neglected the conversation of
	the metaphysician, and, when he returned to England, had entertained <span
	class="special_name">Pope</span>, <span class="special_name">Swift</span>, <span
	class="special_name">Gay</span>, and <span class="special_name">Arbuthnot</span>
	with satirical descriptions of the &#8216;compliment extern&#8217; of his eccentric host, he
	would have acted just as wisely as many an English tourist, with whose malicious
	pleasantry on our habits of chewing, spitting, and eating, we are silly enough
	to quarrel. To the United States in reference to the pop-gun shots of foreign
	tourists, might be addressed the warning which Peter Plymley thundered against
	<span class="special_name">Bonaparte</span>, in reference to the Anti-Jacobin
	jests of <span class="special_name">Canning</span>: Tremble, oh! thou land of
	many spitters and voters, &#8216;for a <em>pleasant</em> man has come out against thee, and
	thou shalt be laid low by a joker of jokes, and he shall talk his pleasant talk
	to thee, and thou shalt be no more!&#8217; In order that America may take its due rank
	in the commonwealth of nations, a literature is needed which shall be the
	exponent of its higher life. We live in times of turbulence and change. There is
	a general dissatisfaction, manifesting itself often in rude contests and ruder
	speech, with the gulf which separates principles from actions. Men are
	struggling to realize dim ideals of right and truth, and each failure adds to
	the desperate earnestness of their efforts. Beneath all the shrewdness and
	selfishness of the American character, there is a smouldering enthusiasm which
	flames out at the first touch of fire; sometimes at the hot and hasty words of
	party, and sometimes at the bidding of great thoughts and unselfish principles.
	The heart of the nation is easily stirred to its depths; but those who rouse its
	fiery impulses into action are often men compounded of ignorance and wickedness,
	and wholly unfitted to guide the passions which they are able to excite. We want
	a poetry which shall speak in clear, loud tones to the people; a poetry which
	shall make us more in love with our native land, by converting its ennobling
	scenery into the images of lofty thoughts; which shall give visible form and
	life to the abstract ideas of our written constitutions; which shall confer upon
	virtue all the strength of principle and all the energy of passion; which shall
	disentangle freedom from cant and senseless hyperbole, and render it a thing of
	such loveliness and grandeur as to justify all self-sacrifice; which shall make
	us love man by the new consecrations it sheds on his life and destiny; which
	shall force through the thin partitions of conventialism and expediency;
	vindicate the majesty of reason; give new power to the voice of conscience, and
	new vitality to human affection; soften and elevate passion; guide enthusiasm in
	a right direction; and speak out in the high language of men to a nation of
	men.&#8217;</p>

	<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page183" name="page183"></a>183</span><span
	class="special_name">The North-American Review</span> for the January quarter is
	one of the best issues of that &#8216;ancient and honorable&#8217; Quarterly which we have
	encountered for many months. It contains eight extended reviews, five brief
	&#8216;Critical Notices,&#8217; and the usual quarterly list of new publications. The first
	article is upon the &#8216;<i>Poets and Poetry of America</i>,&#8217; a work &#8216;which has travelled
	through many States and four editions,&#8217; and for the production of which Mr.
	<span class="special_name">Griswold</span> is justly commended. In the progress
	of this paper, the writer indulges in a sort of running commentary upon the more
	conspicuous poets included in the compiler&#8217;s collection, as <span
	class="special_name">Bryant</span>, <span class="special_name">Halleck</span>,
	<span class="special_name">Sprague</span>, <span
	class="special_name">Dana,</span> <span class="special_name">Percival</span>, <span
	class="special_name">Longfellow</span>, <span class="special_name">Willis
	Gaylord Clark</span>, <span class="special_name">Holmes</span>, <span
	class="special_name">Whittier</span>, etc., etc. Of <span
	class="special_name">Bryant</span> the reviewer among other things remarks:</p>

	<div class="quotation">
		<p>&#8216;<span class="special_name">Mr. Griswold</span> says finely of <span
		class="special_name">Bryant</span>, that &#8216;he is the translator of the
		silent language of nature to the world.&#8217; The serene beauty and thoughtful
		tenderness, which characterize his descriptions, or rather interpretations of
		outward objects, are paralleled only in <span
		class="special_name">Wordsworth</span>. His poems are almost perfect of their
		kind. The fruits of meditation, rather than of passion or imagination, and
		rarely startling with an unexpected image or sudden outbreak of feeling, they
		are admirable specimens of what may be called the philosophy of the soul. They
		address the finer instincts of our nature with a voice so winning and gentle;
		they search out with such subtle power all in the heart which is true and good;
		that their influence, though quiet, is resistless. They have consecrated to many
		minds things which before it was painful to contemplate. Who can say that his
		feelings and fears respecting death have not received an insensible change,
		since reading the &#8216;Thanatopsis?&#8217; Indeed, we think that <span
		class="special_name">Bryant&#8217;s</span> poems are valuable, not only for
		their intrinsic excellence, but for the vast influence their wide circulation is
		calculated to exercise on national feelings and manners. It is impossible to
		read them without being morally benefitted. They purify as well as please. They
		develope or encourage all the elevated and thoughtful tendencies of the
		mind.&#8217;</p>
	</div>

	<p>We are glad to see the reproof which the reviewer bestows upon those critics of
	<span class="special_name">Longfellow&#8217;s</span> poetry, who to escape the trouble
	of analysis, offer some smooth eulogium upon his &#8216;taste,&#8217; or some lip-homage to
	his &#8216;artistical ability,&#8217; instead of noting the tendency of his writings to
	touch the heroic strings in our nature, to breathe energy into the heart, to
	sustain our lagging purposes, and fix our thoughts on what is stable and
	eternal. The following is eminently just:</p>

	<div class="quotation">
		<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">The</span> great characteristic of <span class="special_name">Longfellow</span>, that
		of addressing the moral nature through the imagination, of linking moral truth
		to intellectual beauty, is a far greater excellence. His artistical ability is
		admirable, because it is not seen. It is rather mental than mechanical. The best
		artist is he who accommodates his diction to his subject. In this sense, <span
		class="special_name">Longfellow</span> is an artist. By learning &#8216;to labor and
		to wait,&#8217; by steadily brooding over the chaos in which thought and emotion first
		appear to the mind, and giving shape and life to both, before uttering them in
		words, he has obtained a singular mastery over expression. By this we do not
		mean that he has a large command of language. No fallacy is greater than that
		which confounds fluency with expression. Washerwomen, and boys at debating
		clubs, often display more fluency than <span
		class="special_name">Webster</span>; but his words are to theirs, as the roll of
		thunder to the patter of rain. Language often receives its significance and
		power from the person who uses it. Unless permeated by the higher faculties of
		the mind, unless it be not the clothing, but the &#8216;incarnation of thought,&#8217; it is
		quite an humble power. There are some writers who repose undoubting confidence
		in words. If their minds be filled with the epithets of poetry, they fondly deem
		that they have clutched its essence. In a piece of inferior verse, we often
		observe a great array of expressions which have been employed with great effect
		by genius, but which seem to burn the fingers and disconcert the equanimity of
		the aspiring word-catcher who presses them into his service. Felicity, not
		fluency, of language is a merit.&#8217;</p>
	</div>

	<p>Exactly; yet these same &#8216;fluent&#8217; versifiers are the persons who talk with
	elaborate flippancy of the &#8216;simple common-places&#8217; of this noble poet! The
	reviewer adds: &#8216;<span class="special_name">Longfellow</span> has a perfect
	command of that expression which results from restraining rather than
	cultivating fluency; and his manner is adapted to his theme. He rarely, if ever,
	mistakes &#8216;emotions for conceptions.&#8217; His words are often pictures of his
	thought. He selects with great delicacy and precision the exact phrase which
	best expresses or suggests his idea. He colors his style with the skill of a
	painter. The warm flush and bright tints, as well as the most evanescent hues of
	language, he uses with admirable discretion. In that higher department of his
	art, that of so combining his words and images that they make music to the soul
	as well as to the ear, and convey not only his feelings and thoughts, but also
	the very tone and condition of the soul in which they have being, he likewise
	excels.&#8217; The reviewer <span class="pagenum"><a id="page184"
	name="page184"></a>184</span>illustrates these remarks, by citing the &#8216;Psalms of
	Life,&#8217; the &#8216;Saga of the Skeleton in Armor,&#8217; &#8216;The Village Blacksmith,&#8217; etc.,
	which were written by Mr. <span class="special_name">Longfellow</span> for the
	pages of this Magazine, and adds, that our poet indulges in no &#8216;wild struggles
	after an ineffable Something, for which earth can afford but imperfect symbols.
	He appears perfectly satisfied with his work. Like his own &#8216;Village Blacksmith,&#8217;
	he retires every night with the feeling that something has been attempted, and
	something <em>done</em>.&#8217; There is a subtle analysis of the style of that first of
	comic poets, <span class="special_name">Holmes</span>, for which we shall
	endeavor to find space hereafter. Of the writings of the late lamented <span
	class="special_name">Willis Gaylord Clark</span>, the reviewer remarks, that
	they &#8216;are all distinguished for a graceful and elegant diction, thoughts morally
	and poetically beautiful, and chaste and appropriate imagery. They exhibit much
	purity and strength of feeling, are replete with fancy and sentiment, and have
	often a searching pathos and a mournful beauty, which find their way quietly to
	the heart.&#8217; The poetry of our friend and correspondent <span
	class="special_name">Whittier</span> is warmly commended: &#8216;A common thought
	comes from his pen &#8216;rammed with life.&#8217; He seems in some of his lyrics to pour
	out his blood with his lines. There is a rush of passion in his verse, which
	sweeps every thing along with it.&#8217; The remaining references are to the
	lady-poets, Mesdames <span class="first_word">Brooks</span>, <span class="first_word">Child</span>, <span class="first_word">Sigourney</span>, <span class="first_word">Smith</span>, <span class="first_word">Welby</span>, <span class="first_word">Hall</span>, <span class="first_word">Ellet</span>,

	<p><span class="ed_table_title">Joseph C. Neal&#8217;s &#8216;Charcoal Sketches.&#8217;</span>&#8212;Right glad are we to welcome from the
	teeming press of Messrs. <span class="special_name">Burgess and Stringer</span> a new edition of these most humorous
	and witty sketches, illustrated with engravings by <span class="special_name">D. C. Johnston</span>, of Boston. We have
	re-perused them with renewed delight, and awakened again the echoes of our silent sanctum,
	in the excess of our cachinnatory enjoyment. Our friend <span class="special_name">Morton M&#8216;Michael</span>, in
	the &#8216;advance <span class="special_name">Graham</span>&#8217; for February, (which by the way contains a breathing likeness of
	the sketcher,) has the following remarks upon the papers composing the volume before us,
	which we most cordially endorse: &#8216;No one, who has his faculties in a healthy condition,
	can read them and not feel convinced that they are the productions of a superior and highly
	gifted mind. They not only smack strongly of what all true men love, genuine humor;
	rich, racy, glorious humor; at which you may indulge in an honest outbreak of laughter,
	and not feel ashamed afterward because you have thrown away good mirth on a pitiful
	jest; but when you have laughed your fill, if you choose to look beneath the surface, which
	sparkles and bubbles with brilliant fancies, you will find an under current of truthful observation,
	abundant in matter for sober thought in your graver moments. In all of them,
	light and trifling as they seem, and pleasant as they unquestionably are, there is a deep
	and solemn moral. The follies and vices which, in weak natures, soon grow into crimes,
	are here presented in such a way as to forewarn those who are about to yield to temptation,
	not by dull monitions and unregarded homilies, but by making the actors themselves unconscious
	protestants against their own misdoings. And to do this well requires a combination
	of abilities such as few possess. There must be the quick eye to perceive, the nice
	judgment to discriminate, the active memory to retain, the vigorous pen to depict, and
	above all, the soul, the mind, the genius, call it what you will, to infuse into the whole life
	and spirit and power. Now, all these qualities Neal has in an eminent degree, and he
	applies them with the skill of an accomplished artist. What he does he does thoroughly,
	perfectly. His portraits, which he modestly calls sketches, are unmistakeable. The very
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page185" name="page185"></a>185</span>men he wishes to portray are before you, and they are not only limned to the outward eye,
	but they speak also to the outward ear, and in sentences thickly clustered with the drollest
	conceits, they convey lessons of practical philosophy, and make revelations of the strange
	perversities of our inward nature, from which even the wise may gather profitable conclusions.&#8217;
	Our friend speaks of Mr. <span class="special_name">Neal&#8217;s</span> being &#8216;comparatively little known.&#8217; We
	have good reason to believe that one great cause of this is, that his name has often been
	confounded with that of another and altogether different species of <span class="special_name">Neal</span>, whose infinite
	twattle&#8212;infinite alike in degree and quantity&#8212;has prejudiced the public mind against
	any thing that may seem to come in &#8216;questionable shape&#8217; from a questionable source. This
	error has had its advantages to <em>one</em> party, no doubt, since there was &#8216;every thing to gain
	and nothing to lose;&#8217; an advantage however which the prefix of the first two initials of
	our friend and correspondent to passages from his work which may hereafter find their way
	into the newspapers, will transfer to the rightful recipient. But to the volume in question,
	from which we are about to make a few random selections, illustrating the characters of
	sundry &#8216;city worthies,&#8217; who are &#8216;comprehended as vagrom men&#8217; by the &#8216;charleys&#8217; or
	watchmen of the good City of Brotherly Love. Let us begin with the soliloquy of the
	poetical <span class="special_name">Olympus Pump</span>:</p>

	<div class="quotation">

	<p>&#8216;&#8216;<span class="first_word">Genius</span> never feels its oats until after
	sunset; twilight applies the spanner to the fire-plug of fancy to give its
	bubbling fountains way; and midnight lifts the sluices for the cataracts of the
	heart, and cries, &#8216;Pass on the water!&#8217; Yes, and economically considered, night
	is this world&#8217;s Spanish cloak; for no matter how dilapidated or festooned one&#8217;s
	apparel may be, the loops and windows cannot be discovered, and we look as
	elegant and as beautiful as get out. Ah!&#8217; continued Pump, as he gracefully
	reclined upon the stall, &#8216;it&#8217;s really astonishing how rich I am in the idea line
	to-night. But it&#8217;s no use. I&#8217;ve got no pencil&#8212;not even a piece of chalk to
	write &#8217;em on my hat for my next poem. It&#8217;s a great pity ideas are so much of the
	soap-bubble order, that you can&#8217;t tie &#8217;em up in a pocket handkerchief, like a
	half peck of potatoes, or string &#8217;em on a stick like catfish. I often have the
	most beautiful notions scampering through my head with the grace, but alas! the
	swiftness too, of kittens, especially just before I get asleep; but they&#8217;re all
	lost for the want of a trap; an intellectual figgery four. I wish we could find
	out the way of sprinkling salt on their tails, and make &#8217;em wait till we want to
	use &#8217;em. Why can&#8217;t some of the meaner souls invent an idea-catcher for the use
	of genius? I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;d find it profitable, for I wouldn&#8217;t mind owing a man
	twenty dollars for one myself.&#8217;</p>


	</div>

	<p>Mr. <span class="special_name">Fydget Fyxington</span> is another worthy, who
	reverts continually to &#8216;first principles,&#8217; and is full of schemes and projects,
	especially when he chances to have &#8216;a stone in his hat.&#8217; Hear him:</p>

	<div class="quotation">

	<p>&#8216;&#8216;<span class="first_word">Nothin&#8217;s</span> fixed no how; our grand-dads must a
	been lazy rascals. Why didn&#8217;t they roof over the side-walks, and not leave every
	thing for us to do? I ain&#8217;t got no numbrell, and besides that, when it comes
	down as if raining was no name for it, as it always does when I&#8217;m cotch&#8217;d out,
	numbrells is no great shakes if you&#8217;ve got one with you, and no shakes at all if
	it&#8217;s at home. It&#8217;s a pity we ain&#8217;t got feathers, so&#8217;s to grow our own jacket and
	trowsers, and do up the tailorin&#8217; business, and make our own feather beds. It
	would be a great savin&#8217;; every man his own clothes, and every man his own
	feather bed. Now I&#8217;ve got a suggestion about that; first principles bring us to
	the skin; fortify that, and the matter&#8217;s done. How would it do to bile a big
	kittle full of tar, tallow, beeswax and injen rubber, with considerable wool,
	and dab the whole family once a week? The young&#8217;uns might be soused in it every
	Saturday night, and the nigger might fix the elderly folks with a whitewash
	brush. Then there wouldn&#8217;t be no bother a washing your clothes or yourself,
	which last is an invention of the doctor to make people sick, because it lets in
	the cold in winter and the heat in summer, when natur&#8217; says shut up the porouses
	and keep &#8217;em out. Besides, when the new invention was tore at the knees or wore
	at the elbows, just tell the nigger to put on the kittle and give you a dab, and
	you&#8217;re patched slick; and so that whole mobs of people mightn&#8217;t stick together
	like figs, a little sperrits of turpentine or litharage might be added to make
	&#8217;em dry like a house-a-fire. &#8217;Twould be nice for sojers. Stand &#8217;em all of a
	row, and whitewash &#8217;em blue or red, according to pattern, as if they were a
	fence. The gin&#8217;rals might look on to see if it was done according to Gunter; the
	cap&#8217;ins might flourish the brush, and the corpulars carry the bucket. Dandies
	could fix themselves all sorts of streaked and all sorts of colors. When the
	parterials is cheap and the making don&#8217;t cost nothing, that&#8217;s what I call
	economy, and coming as near as possible to first principles. It&#8217;s a better way,
	too, of keeping out the rain, than my t&#8217;other plan of flogging people when
	they&#8217;re young, to make their hides hard and water-proof. A good licking is a
	sound first principle for juveniles, but they&#8217;ve got a prejudice agin it.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;A pair of Slippers&#8217; brings us acquainted with another original personage, who
	one dark night soliloquizes on this wise:</p>

	<div class="quotation">

	<p>&#8216;&#8216;<span class="first_word">I&#8217;ve</span> not the slightest doubt that this is as
	beautiful a night as ever was; only it&#8217;s so dark you can&#8217;t see the pattern of
	it. One night is pretty much like another night in the dark; but it&#8217;s a great
	advantage to a good-looking evening, if the lamps are lit, so you can twig the
	stars and the moonshine. <span class="pagenum"><a id="page186"
	name="page186"></a>186</span>The fact is, that in this &#8216;ere city, we do grow the
	blackest moons, and the hardest moons to find, I ever did see. Lamps is lamps,
	and moons is moons, in a business pint of view, but practically they ain&#8217;t much
	if the wicks ain&#8217;t afire. When the luminaries are, as I may say, in the raw,
	it&#8217;s bad for me. I can&#8217;t see the ground as perforately as little fellers, and
	every dark night I&#8217;m sure to get a hyst; either a forrerd hyst, or a backerd
	hyst, or some sort of a hyst; but more backerds than forrerds, &#8216;specially in
	winter. One of the most unfeeling tricks I know of, is the way some folks have
	got of laughing out, yaw-haw! when they see a gentleman ketching a reg&#8217;lar hyst;
	a long gentleman, for instance, with his legs in the air, and his noddle splat
	down upon the cold bricks. A hyst of itself is bad enough, without being
	sniggered at: first, your sconce gets a crack; then, you see all sorts of stars,
	and have free admission to the fire-works; then, you scramble up, feeling as if
	you had no head on your shoulders, and as if it wasn&#8217;t you, but some confounded
	disagreeable feller in your clothes; yet the jacksnipes all grin, as if the
	misfortunes of human nature was only a poppet show. I wouldn&#8217;t mind it, if you
	could get up and look as if you didn&#8217;t care. But a man can&#8217;t rise, after a royal
	hyst, without letting on he feels flat. In such cases, however, sympathy is all
	gammon; and as for sensibility of a winter&#8217;s day, people keep it all for their
	own noses, and can&#8217;t be coaxed to retail it by the small.&#8217;</p>

	<p>&#8216;<span class="special_name">Dilly Jones</span>&#8217; is one of those unfortunate
	wights &#8216;just whose luck&#8217; it is never to succeed in any thing they undertake. In
	a state of &#8216;mellow&#8217; mental abstraction, while lamenting that the trade of one&#8217;s
	early days might not likewise be the trade of one&#8217;s latter years, he
	unconsciously utters his thoughts aloud:</p>

	<div class="quotation">

	<p>&#8216;&#8216;<span class="first_word">Sawing</span> wood&#8217;s going all to smash,&#8217; said he,
	&#8216;and that&#8217;s where every thing goes what I speculates in. This here coal is doing
	us up. Ever since these black stones was brought to town, the wood-sawyers and
	pilers, and them soap-fat and hickory-ashes men, has been going down; and, for
	my part, I can&#8217;t say as I see what&#8217;s to be the end of all their new-fangled
	contraptions. But it&#8217;s always so; I&#8217;m always crawling out of the little end of
	the horn. I began life in a comfortable sort of a way; selling oysters out of a
	wheel-barrow, all clear grit, and didn&#8217;t owe nobody nothing. Oysters went down
	slick enough for a while, but at last cellars was invented, and darn the oyster,
	no matter how nice it was pickled, could poor Dill sell; so I had to eat up
	capital and profits myself. Then the &#8216;pepree-pot smoking&#8217; was sot up, and went
	ahead pretty considerable for a time; but a parcel of fellers come into it, said
	my cats wasn&#8217;t as good as their&#8217;n, when I know&#8217;d they was as fresh as any cats
	in the market; and pepree-pot was no go. Bean-soup was just as bad; people said
	kittens wasn&#8217;t good done that way, and the more I hollered, the more the
	customers wouldn&#8217;t come, and them what did, wanted tick. Along with the boys and
	their pewter fips, them what got trust and didn&#8217;t pay, and the abusing of my
	goods, I was soon fotch&#8217;d up in the victualling line&#8212;and I busted for the
	benefit of my creditors. But genius riz. I made a raise of a horse and saw,
	after being a wood-piler&#8217;s prentice for a while, and working till I was free,
	and now here comes the coal to knock this business in the head.&#8217; · · · &#8216;I wonder
	if they wouldn&#8217;t list me for a Charley? Hollering oysters and bean-soup has guv&#8217;
	me a splendid woice; and instead of skeering &#8217;em away, if the thieves were to
	hear me singing out, my style of doing it would almost coax &#8217;em to come and be
	took up. They&#8217;d feel like a bird when a snake is after it, and would walk up,
	and poke their coat collars right into my fist. Then, after a while, I&#8217;d perhaps
	be promoted to the fancy business of pig ketching, which, though it is werry
	light and werry elegant, requires genus. &#8217;Tisn&#8217;t every man that can come the
	scientifics in that line, and has studied the nature of a pig, so as to beat him
	at canœuvering, and make him surrender &#8216;cause he sees it ain&#8217;t no use of doing
	nothing. It wants larning to conwince them critters, and it&#8217;s only to be done by
	heading &#8217;em up handsome, hopping which ever way they hop, and tripping &#8217;em up
	genteel by shaking hands with their off hind leg. I&#8217;d scorn to pull their tails
	out by the roots, or to hurt their feelin&#8217;s by dragging &#8217;em about by the ears.
	But what&#8217;s the use? If I was listed, they&#8217;d soon find out to holler the hour and
	to ketch the thieves by steam; yes, and they&#8217;d take &#8217;em to court on a railroad,
	and try &#8217;em with biling water. They&#8217;ll soon have black locomotives for watchmen
	and constables, and big bilers for judges and mayors. Pigs will be ketched by
	steam, and will be biled fit to eat before they are done squealing. By and by,
	folks won&#8217;t be of no use at all. There won&#8217;t be no people in the world but
	tea-kittles; no mouths, but safety-valves; and no talking, but blowing off
	steam. If I had a little biler inside of me, I&#8217;d turn omnibus, and week-days I&#8217;d
	run from Kensington to the Navy Yard, and Sundays I&#8217;d run to Fairmount.&#8217;&#8217;</p>

	<p>There is a world of wisdom in the syllabus, or &#8216;argument,&#8217; prefixed to each
	sketch; but for these we must refer the reader to the volume itself. The <span
	class="special_name">Dogberrys</span> too are as wise as their &#8216;illustrious
	predecessor,&#8217; and are quite as profuse of advice to &#8216;the plaintiffs&#8217; who fall
	into their hands. Take a single specimen: &#8216;Take keer&#8212;don&#8217;t persume; I&#8217;m a
	&#8216;fishal functionary out a-ketching of dogs. You mustn&#8217;t cut up because it&#8217;s
	night. The mayor and the &#8216;squires has gone to bed; but the law is a thing that
	never gets asleep. After ten o&#8217;clock the law is a watchman and a dog-ketcher;
	we&#8217;re the whole law till breakfast&#8217;s a&#8217;most ready.&#8217; &#8216;You&#8217;re a clever enough kind
	of little feller, sonny; but you ain&#8217;t been eddicated to the law as I have; so
	I&#8217;ll give you a lecture. Justice vinks at vot it can&#8217;t see, and lets them off
	vot it can&#8217;t ketch. When you want to break it, you must dodge. You may do what
	you like in your own house, and the law don&#8217;t know nothing about the matter. But
	never go thumping and bumping about the streets, when you are primed and
	snapped. That&#8217;s intemperance, and the other is temperance. But now you <span
	class="pagenum"><a id="page187" name="page187"></a>187</span>come under the
	muzzle of the ordinance; you&#8217;re a loafer.&#8217; One of these &#8216;&#8216;fishal functionaries&#8217;
	justifies extreme physical means in &#8216;captivating obstropolous vagroms&#8217; both by
	reason and distinguished precedent: &#8216;Wolloping is the only way; it&#8217;s a panacea
	for differences of opinion. You&#8217;ll find it in history books, that one nation
	teaches another what it didn&#8217;t know before by wolloping it; that&#8217;s the method of
	civilizing savages; the Romans put the whole world to rights that way; and
	what&#8217;s right on the big figger must be right on the small scale. In short,
	there&#8217;s nothing like wolloping for taking the conceit out of fellows who think
	they know more than their betters.&#8217; &#8216;And so forth, et cetera,&#8217; as may be
	ascertained on a perusal of the volume.</p>

	<p><span class="ed_table_title">Life and Times of the late William Abbott: Third
	Notice.</span>&#8212;This most entertaining manuscript-volume, from which we have
	already drawn so largely for the entertainment of our readers, has not been
	published in America, as it was designed to have been, owing partly as we learn
	to the fact that, through &#8216;something like unfair dealing&#8217; toward the widow of
	the writer, a copy of half the volume had been transmitted to England, parts of
	which have already reached this country in the pages of a London magazine. We
	had the pleasure to anticipate by a month or two the best portions even of these
	printed chapters; and we proceed to select passages from other divisions of this
	interesting auto-biography, which were written out after a duplicate copy of the
	earlier chapters had been transmitted to the London publisher. Mr. <span
	class="special_name">Abbott</span> (aside from the society to which he had the
	entrée on account of his professional merits,) was a personal favorite with many
	of the most eminent personages among the English nobility, with whom he was on
	terms of close intimacy; but we never find him illustrating his own importance
	by the narration of the social anecdotes or careless table-talk of his
	distinguished friends, as too many of his contemporaries have done. He was
	honored with the cordial friendship of the <span class="special_name">Earls
	Glengall</span> and <span class="special_name">Fitzharding</span>; and &#8216;at their
	tables,&#8217; he writes, &#8216;I was a frequent guest, where I constantly met with society
	embracing the highest rank and most distinguished talent in England. I refrain,
	from obvious reasons, from mentioning names; but I may say that if there was
	ever a class of persons who confer honor upon the society in which they mingle,
	it is <em>the Aristocracy of Great-Britain</em>. There is a delicacy and forbearance in
	their manner, and that air of perfect equality which is so indicative of the
	accomplished gentleman and scholar. <span class="special_name">Colman</span> was
	a very frequent guest at these dinners, and was, with the exception perhaps of
	<span class="special_name">Lord Alvanley</span>, one of the most brilliant
	diners-out in London.&#8217; This testimony, let us remark in passing, in favor of the
	ease and simplicity of the really high-born gentlemen of England, is confirmed
	by all Americans who have been well received in English society. The reader will
	especially remember the tribute paid on this point by Mr. <span
	class="special_name">Sanderson</span>, the accomplished &#8216;American in Paris,&#8217; in
	his &#8216;Familiar Letters from London,&#8217; in these pages. But we are standing before
	Mr. <span class="special_name">Abbott</span>. In Edinburgh &#8216;there lies the
	scene:&#8217;</p>


	<div class="quotation">

	<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">I again</span> visited Edinburgh at the close of the
	Covent-Garden season, and received the same undiminished hospitality as on a
	former occasion. I established an intimacy with the <span
	class="special_name">Ballantines</span> of celebrated <span
	class="special_name">Scott</span> memory. <span
	class="special_name">Matthews</span> was indebted to <span
	class="special_name">John Ballantine</span> for his famous old Scotch woman, and
	he certainly rivalled his preceptor in the quaint and dry humor with which he
	narrated that most amusing story. The management of the Edinburgh Theatre rested
	in the hands of Mr. <span class="special_name">Murray</span>. He was the only
	son of the <span class="special_name">Murray</span> formerly of Covent-Garden
	Theatre, who was one of the most chaste and impressive actors I ever saw. His
	Adam, in &#8216;As you Like it,&#8217; was really the perfection of the art. Mrs. <span
	class="special_name">Henry Siddons</span>, in whom the property was vested at
	the death of her husband, was, fortunately for me, residing with her charming
	family in Edinburgh, and I was a constant guest at her table. Her manners were
	fascinating in the extreme, and a greater compliment could not well be paid than
	in having the entrée to a family so intellectual in their resources, and so
	perfectly amiable in disposition. A very amusing and agreeable club was got up
	by a party of young <span class="pagenum"><a id="page188"
	name="page188"></a>188</span>advocates. Delightful it was, from its very
	absurdity; in fact the nonsense of men of sense is an admirable couch to repose
	upon. Our numbers were limited, and embraced some of that powerful intellect
	which the modern Athens possesses in so eminent degree. Mr. <span
	class="special_name">Miles Angus Fletcher</span>, Mr. <span
	class="special_name">Anderson</span>, Sir <span class="special_name">William
	Hamilton</span>, and a son of the late and brother of the present Lord <span
	class="special_name">Meadowbank</span>, were among those I knew intimately, and
	whose varied talents gave life and soul to the society. We scorned the
	artificial light that illumined our midnight orgies, and seldom separated before
	the beams of the sun were dancing in our festive cups.&#8217;</p>

	<p>The following account of the first <i>Theatrical Fund Dinner</i>, an entertainment of
	which we hear so much latterly in England, with the defence of actors against
	the charges of extravagance and improvidence so often brought against them, will
	possess interest for American readers:</p>


	<div class="quotation">

	<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">The</span> Covent-Garden Theatrical Fund about this
	period was languishing for want of support; and the great importance to be
	derived from an increase of its means seriously occupied the attention of the
	committee. We naturally looked upon it as affording an opportunity of increasing
	the respectability of the profession, and the means of preventing those
	individual appeals to the public from our impoverished brethren. There is a
	popular delusion that actors form a class in which the most reckless profusion
	is displayed; that the habits of their lives are necessarily dissipated, and
	that in the enjoyments of the luxuries of to-day, the wants and cares of
	to-morrow are entirely lost sight of. I do not believe in these sweeping
	assertions. I will not pretend to say that actors are exempt from the frailties
	of humanity; nay, I will admit that their course of life perhaps exposes them to
	greater temptations; but this fact ought rather to operate in their favor, than
	to tell so powerfully against them. I would ask those persons who are so
	inimical to the profession of an actor, whether longevity is the result of
	dissipation; and if they will take the trouble of examining, they will find that
	actors in general are extremely long-lived. There is a want of thriftiness in
	their composition, I grant; and fortunately for them the same charge is brought
	against the poet; the man whose high intellectual powers prevent his descending
	to the level of this work-day world. But will any one take the trouble of
	explaining from whence the actor is to derive his wealth? We will imagine that
	his salary is respectable, that it is regularly paid, and that there is no
	excuse for his being in debt. And now take into consideration that he has an
	appearance to maintain; that he has a family to support; and then what becomes
	of the opportunity of laying by a modicum even, to guard against the decline of
	life when the &#8216;winter daisies&#8217; shall crown his head, and a new race of
	performers have started up and driven the others from their posts? We have some
	rare instances of very large fortunes being made and retained by members of the
	profession it is true, but they were instances of dazzling genius, or had the
	world&#8217;s belief that they possessed it. I will take names within the memory of us
	all: Mrs. <span class="special_name">Siddons</span>, Mr. <span
	class="special_name">Kemble</span>, Miss <span
	class="special_name">O&#8217;Neil</span>, the &#8216;Young Roscius,&#8217; and the late Mr. <span
	class="special_name">Lewis</span>; and I will add to that list men of
	accomplished talents and great honor to the profession; <span
	class="special_name">Young</span>, <span class="special_name">Bannister</span>,
	<span class="special_name">Munden</span>, <span
	class="special_name">Braham</span>, <span class="special_name">Wroughton</span>,
	<span class="special_name">Liston</span>, <span
	class="special_name">Harley</span>, <span class="special_name">Johnstone</span>,
	<span class="special_name">Power</span>, <span
	class="special_name">Jones</span>; and I am sure the reader will believe me when
	I state, that I heartily wish I could place my own name in the list. Take the
	members of any other profession, however honorable, limit their numbers and
	means to the same proportion, and I ask if you would be enabled to produce a
	greater list of independent persons. The great advantages to be derived from a
	Theatrical Fund are here I trust made apparent; and after many suggestions, I
	believe it fell to the lot of <span class="special_name">Charles Taylor</span>
	to propose an annual public dinner; and it proved a most fortunate idea. The
	first great point to be obtained was a patron, and then a president for the
	dinner. Our application met with immediate success, and His Royal Highness the
	<span class="special_name">Prince Regent</span> condescendingly gave his name at
	the head of our undertaking, accompanied by a solid mark of his favor in the
	donation of one hundred pounds. We then had the gracious consent of the <span
	class="special_name">Duke of York</span> to be our President, aided by his Royal
	brothers <span class="special_name">Kent</span> and <span
	class="special_name">Sussex</span>. The list of vice-presidents embraced many of
	the most distinguished noblemen and gentlemen in the country. In what an amiable
	point of view do the Royal Princes place themselves before the public in so
	thoroughly identifying themselves with the many interesting charities to which
	London gives birth! The grateful spirit of joyousness which they invariably
	displayed on these occasions, gave an interest to the festive scenes, and
	confirmed many a heart in its loyalty to their illustrious house. The late <span
	class="special_name">Duke of Gordon</span> sat on the right hand of the Royal
	President, and favored the company with a song, which greatly surprised them,
	and elicited a general encore, and with which, with great good humor, he
	immediately complied. <span class="special_name">Matthews</span> always held a
	conspicuous position at these dinners, and made a point of giving an original
	song, selected from his forth-coming entertainment. The <span class="pagenum"><a
	id="page189" name="page189"></a>189</span>amount collected at our first dinner
	was extraordinary; no less a sum than one thousand eight hundred and seventy
	pounds. The Drury-Lane Fund in the following year adapted our plan of the
	dinner, and both these institutions now annually derive a very large sum from
	the volunteer subscriptions of the Friends of the Drama. The same Royal
	patronage is most graciously continued by her present Majesty, and Royalty
	continues to preside at the festival. With this accumulation of patronage the
	actor may fearlessly look forward to the close of his mortal career without the
	dread of eleemosynary contributions, and also feel the proud gratification that
	he has personally contributed to support so interesting a Fund.&#8217;</p>

	<p>As a specimen of Mr. <span class="special_name">Abbott&#8217;s&#8217;</span> stock-breaking
	and gambling experiences, we quote the subjoined passages:</p>


	<div class="quotation">

	<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">A friend</span> of mine connected with the Stock Exchange on one occasion pointed out
	to me the great advantage of occasionally purchasing five thousand consuls on
	time, knowing that I had capital unemployed; the certain profits were placed
	before me in such an agreeable point of view, that I could not resist the bait.
	In the course of two days I received a check for fifty pounds, a sum by no means
	unpleasant, considering that I had not advanced one farthing. The natural
	consequence was that I repeated the dose with various success until I was
	ultimately well plucked. I sustained a loss of one thousand pounds. I then began
	to be very uneasy, until I fortunately discovered that by one <i>coup</i> I had made
	two hundred pounds. My broker had waddled of course, without being able to make
	up his differences. The parties of whom I had purchased, through my agent,
	refused to pay me, as they had no knowledge of a third person, and were
	themselves considerable sufferers by the aforesaid broker. I could not
	understand the justice of this measure, for I had always paid my losses to the
	moment; so I walked to Temple-Bar, pulled off my hat most gracefully to that
	venerable arch, and vowed never again to pass it in the pursuit of ill-gotten
	wealth. I had always a perfect horror of <em>gambling</em>, and little imagined I was
	pursuing it in a wholesale manner. To satisfy my inordinate curiosity, for
	sight-seeing, I have twice or thrice in my life passed the threshhold of a
	gambling-house in London, but never felt the least personal desire to embark the
	smallest sum, although keenly alive to the dangerous excitement in others. On
	one of these occasions it fell to my lot to witness a most affecting and trying
	scene. The names of the parties came to my knowledge afterward, which from
	delicacy I of course suppress. A gentleman had for some years been separated
	from his wife, in consequence of infidelity on her part with a man of high
	fashion, an officer of the Guards. An action and divorce ensued; but two
	children whom he had previous to this unfortunate event, he refused to
	acknowledge, thus endeavoring to put the stain of illegitimacy upon them. Years
	rolled on, and the father and son never met. Rouge-et-Noir was the fashionable
	game of the day, and Pall-Mall and St. James-street swarmed with
	gambling-houses. Two gentlemen were quarrelling upon a point, each accusing the
	other of taking the stake. The younger man was the officer on guard that day,
	and consequently in uniform. High words ensued; cards were exchanged; and in one
	moment, from the most ungovernable rage, they became motionless as statues. The
	silence was at length interrupted by an explanation of &#8216;By Heaven! my son!&#8217; This
	remark was made from the impulse of the moment, and probably struck a chord in
	the parent&#8217;s heart that let loose all his affections. They retired to another
	apartment; explanations ensued; and a reconciliation was the result.&#8217;</p>


	</div>


	<p>Elsewhere Mr. <span class="special_name">Abbott</span> describes the
	gambling-houses of Paris, &#8216;those dens of iniquity,&#8217; as he terms them. &#8216;The
	varied scenes of frantic joy and human debasement,&#8217; he writes, &#8216;which I
	witnessed at <span class="special_name">Frascati&#8217;s</span>, were truly appalling.
	The extremes of excitement were as powerfully exhibited in the loser of twenty
	francs as in the man who had lost his twenty thousand.&#8217; The annexed sketch of
	the lamented career of poor <span class="special_name">Conway</span>, who will
	be &#8216;freshly remembered&#8217; by many of our readers in the Atlantic cities, is
	authentic in every particular. It is not without its lesson, in more regards
	than one:</p>


	<div class="quotation">

	<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">I find</span> I have neglected to mention an actor, who stood sufficiently forward,
	both by his position and his misfortunes, to be entitled to a respectful notice;
	I mean Mr. <span class="special_name">Conway</span>. He was said to be the
	illegitimate offspring of a distinguished nobleman; but whether his own pride
	prevented his making advances, and he was resolved to lay the foundation of his
	own fame and fortune, or whether he met with a check upon his natural feelings
	from one who was bound to support him, I know not; but, gifted as he was with a
	commanding person, a most gentlemanlike deportment, and advantages peculiarly
	adapted for the stage, it is no wonder that the histrionic art held forth
	inducements and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page190"
	name="page190"></a>190</span>hopes of obtaining a brighter position than any
	other career open to him, without the aid of pecuniary means, and the patronage
	which was withheld from him. He made his appearance in 1813, the season previous
	to <span class="special_name">Kean</span>, in the character of &#8216;Alexander the
	Great.&#8217; He met with a very flattering reception, and produced a great effect
	upon the fair sex. Indeed, the actors, who are upon these occasions lynx-eyed,
	could not avoid their remarks upon a certain Duchess, who never missed one of
	his performances, and appeared to take the deepest interest in his success.
	<span class="special_name">Conway</span> was upward of six feet in height. He
	was deficient in strong intellectual expression, yet he had the reputation of
	being very handsome. His head was too small for his frame, and his complexion
	too light and sanguine for the profound and varied emotions of deep tragedy.
	There was a tinge of affectation in his deportment, which had the effect of
	creating among many a strong feeling of prejudice against him. His bearing was
	always gentlemanly, and with the exception of a slight superciliousness of
	manner, amiable to every body; and his talent, though not of the highest order,
	was still sufficiently prominent to enable him to maintain a distinguished
	position. And yet this man, with so little to justify spleen, was literally,
	from an unaccountable prejudice, driven from the stage by one of the leading
	weekly journals, edited by a gentleman whose biting satire was death to those
	who had the misfortune to come under his lash. In complete disgust, he retired
	from the boards, and filled the humble situation of prompter at the
	Haymarket-Theatre, but afterward left for the United States, where he became a
	great favorite. But the canker was at his heart. He again quitted the stage, and
	prepared himself for the Church; but there again he was foiled. The ministers of
	our holy religion refused to receive him, not from any moral stain upon his
	character, but because he had been an actor! What is to become of the
	priesthood, who in the early periods were the only actors, and selected
	scriptural subjects for representation? He left in a packet for Savannah,
	overwhelmed with misery and disappointment. &#8216;Ushered into the world by a parent
	who would not acknowledge him; driven out of it in the belief that he was the
	proscribed of Heaven!&#8217; At the moment they were passing the bar at Charleston, he
	threw himself overboard. Efforts were made to save him; a settee was thrown over
	for him to cling to until they could adopt more decisive measures for his
	rescue. He saw the object; but his resolution was taken. He waved his hand, and
	sunk to rise no more. I have reason to believe, that the gentleman to whom I
	have alluded as having made such fearful use of his editorial powers, felt deep
	remorse when the news of his ill-timed death arrived. He also is now no more!
	Poor <span class="special_name">Conway</span>! Had he possessed more nerve, he
	might still have triumphed over the unkindness of his fate:</p>

	<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">The</span> world never witnessed such powerful scenes of exciting interest as took
	possession of Great Britain about this period. The people were drunk with
	enthusiasm. One victory followed so rapidly on the heels of another, that they
	had not time to sober down. The peninsular campaign had closed, and the hitherto
	sacred soil of France was invaded. The restoration of legitimacy, and the
	momentary enthusiasm of the French in favor of their exiled monarch, disturbed
	the intellects of half mankind. The magnificent entrée of <span
	class="special_name">Louis</span> the Eighteenth into London from Heartwell
	Park, where he had resided for some years, almost conveyed the idea that it was
	his own capital he was entering, after his long and weary exile. The silken
	banner with the <i>fleur de lis</i> flaunting from the walls of Devonshire-House and
	all the neighboring mansions in Piccadilly; immense cavalcades of gentlemen
	superbly mounted, all wearing the white cockade; the affectionate sympathy and
	profound respect shown by all classes toward the illustrious representative of
	the Bourbons, was touching in the extreme. On his route from Heartwell, and
	through Stanmore, troops of yeomanry turned out to give him an honorable escort;
	and what could be <em>more</em> honorable than the voluntary attendance of the farmers
	who represented the very bone and sinew of the country? The large portly figure
	of the <span class="special_name">King</span> perfectly disabused <span
	class="special_name">John Bull</span> of the long-cherished idea that Frenchmen
	lived entirely upon frogs. Even that particular fact interested them, and
	repeated huzzas greeted him throughout the whole of his route to London. On his
	arrival at Guillon&#8217;s Hotel in Albermarle-street, which had been most splendidly
	prepared for his reception, His Royal Highness the <span
	class="special_name">Prince Regent</span> received him with that delicate
	attention so worthy of his high and gallant bearing; and there <span
	class="special_name">Louis</span> must have met with one of the most touching
	scenes that ever thrilled the human heart. One hundred and fifty of the ancient
	noblesse were waiting, after years of hopeless expectation, to greet the head of
	that illustrious house, the recollection of whose sufferings awakened the most
	painful feelings. Not one of <span class="pagenum"><a id="page191"
	name="page191"></a>191</span>them but had shared in the horrors of that bloody
	revolution; and not one of them but truly felt that the happiness of that moment
	repaid them for all their sufferings.&#8217;</p>

	<p>A rich specimen of the pompous ignorance sometimes exhibited by theatrical
	managers is afforded in the following anecdote, which has appeared in England,
	but which we are sure will be relished by our readers. It may seem extraordinary
	that a manager should be such an ignoramus; but &#8216;half the actors on the English
	stage,&#8217; says a recent writer, &#8216;dare not address a gentleman a note, lest they
	should &#8216;show their hands:&#8217;&#8217;</p>


	<div class="quotation">

	<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">When</span> I first became a member of
	Covent-Garden, Mr. <span class="special_name">Fawcett</span> held the reins of
	management, in consequence of the retirement of Mr. <span
	class="special_name">Kemble</span> from that position. He had experience to
	guide him, but he unfortunately possessed a dictatorial manner, and a want of
	that refinement and education which had so distinguished his great predecessor.
	In speaking of his public position, however, let me pay homage to his private
	virtues. He was a tender husband, an affectionate father, and a warm friend.
	During my first season a play was produced called the &#8216;<i>Students of Salamanca</i>.&#8217;
	The author was Mr. <span class="special_name">Jamieson</span>, a member of the
	bar, who had been particularly successful in several light pieces produced at
	the Haymarket. Mr. <span class="special_name">Jones</span> and myself were &#8216;The
	Students,&#8217; and it occurred to me in my character to say, &#8216;My danger was
	imminent.&#8217; These words had scarcely passed my lips, when a dark and lowering
	look dimmed the countenance of the manager. I saw that something was wrong, but
	was quite at a loss to guess the cause. At the end of the scene, unwilling to
	mortify me in the presence of the company, he beckoned me aside, and said:
	&#8216;Young man, do you know what you said?&#8217; I changed color, feeling that something
	fearful had occurred. I replied, very much agitated, that I was not aware of any
	error. &#8216;I thought so! Do you know where you are? You are in <em>London</em>, not in
	Bath!&#8217; The fact was so self-evident that I did not attempt to disprove it. &#8216;You
	will be delivered up to scorn and contempt; the critics will immolate you; the
	eyes of this great metropolis are fixed upon you. I thought you were a
	well-educated young man, but I have been deceived&#8212;grossly deceived!&#8217; The effect
	of this tirade may be more easily conceived than described. My face flushed, my
	heart beat, and I at length mustered courage to say, &#8216;For heaven&#8217;s sake, Sir,
	pray tell me; I am extremely sorry&#8212;deeply regret&#8212;but pray tell me!&#8217; The
	kindness of his disposition got the better of his pedantry, and seeing the
	agitation under which I was really suffering, he replied: &#8216;Do you remember that
	you said your danger was <em>imminent</em>&#8217;? Now, Sir, there is no such word in the
	English language: it is <em>eminent!!</em>&#8217; Need I mention the unbounded relief this
	explanation gave me? I quietly suggested the difference of their significations,
	and was never after troubled with any corrections. He was a man of sterling
	qualities, somewhat like a melon, as his friend <span

	<p>In the way of a hoax, we remember nothing more cleverly performed, than the
	rather cruel one whose execution is pleasantly recorded below:</p>


	<div class="quotation">

	<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">There</span> was a lady attached to the Worthing
	Theatre, (mark me, reader, I did not say attached to <em>me</em>,) who was very
	eccentric, and who was, &#8216;small blame to her,&#8217; as the Irishman says, also very
	susceptible. I was on very intimate terms with Mr. <span
	class="special_name">Harley</span>, who was then at Worthing; and one day, while
	quietly dining together, we mutually agreed that there was a fickleness about
	this lady which deserved some reproof. We were really liberal in our feelings,
	and would not have objected to her shooting an extra dart occasionally; but it
	was not to be borne that she should let fly a whole quiver at once. We had
	observed that by way of having two or more strings to her bow, she had got up a
	flirtation with the leader of the band, a most respectable man by the way, and
	of considerable talent. After giving the affair all due consideration, we
	decided upon a mock-duel, in which I was to personate one of the heroes, my
	rival being the aforesaid leader. We carefully and ostentatiously avoided all
	appearance of communication, and in such a way that it always reached her
	knowledge. Thus by gentle innuendoes she discovered that something serious was
	in contemplation, and of course she was not a little flattered, as she was the
	object of dispute. Our duelling-pistols were one day ostentatiously paraded, and
	evident anxiety took possession of the company, who were carefully excluded from
	the secret. The following morning at five o&#8217;clock we each left our lodgings,
	accompanied by our seconds, the rain pouring in torrents. <span
	class="special_name">Harley</span> then went to the lodgings of the frail or
	rather fair one, knocked at the door most violently, and at length she appeared
	at the window, in evident alarm. He urged her if she had the feelings of a woman
	immediately to accompany him, and prevent murder; briefly stating, that her
	&#8216;beauties were the cause and most accursed effect.&#8217; In a state of <span
	class="pagenum"><a id="page192" name="page192"></a>192</span>real excitement,
	mixed up with woman&#8217;s vanity, she rushed out of the house, and accompanied that
	wag of wags. A white beaver hat, sweet emblem of her purity, was on her head,
	and partially concealed her disordered ringlets, hastily gathered together. We
	arranged with <span class="special_name">Harley</span> always to keep ourselves
	a certain distance in advance on the pathway bordering the sands. The first
	thing that occurred was a sudden gust of wind which swept the white beaver a
	considerable distance and covered it with mud; her flowing locks then fell upon
	her alabaster neck, and her romantic appearance was perfect. We most cruelly led
	her on a distance of at least two miles, and took our station near some
	lime-kilns, close to the sea. When she was sufficiently near, one of the seconds
	stepped forward and gave the signal by dropping a blood-stained handkerchief,
	prepared for the occasion. Bang! bang! went the pistols; when she gracefully
	sank into the arms of <span class="special_name">Harley</span>, who held her in
	a fine melo-dramatic attitude. The report was soon over all the town, and of
	course in the newspapers. My adversary put his arm in a sling, and whenever I
	happened to be near her, in a perfect state of despair I vowed that I could
	never forgive myself for having shot my friend. We mutually repulsed her by
	severe looks whenever she approached us; and she soon left the Worthing Theatre
	to seek for victims of less sensibility in other places.&#8217;</p>

	hastily-jotted thoughts in the pages of the <span

	partly divine from the present number, and which we could impart more directly
	in a private note. We agree with him entirely in his views; and if he will
	permit us, we will here quote a passage from an article which we penned upon a
	subject collateral to his general theme, many years ago, before we were hampered
	with the professional &#8216;<em>we</em>,&#8217; and could write out of our &#8216;company dress.&#8217; It is
	a little sketch of the first public singing, save that of the church, to which
	we had ever listened: &#8216;How well do I remember it! It was at the theatre of a
	country village; a rough, barn-like edifice, at which several Stentor-lunged
	Thespians &#8216;from the New-York and Philadelphia Theatres&#8217; split the ears of the
	groundlings, and murdered <span class="special_name">Shakspeare&#8217;s</span> heroes
	and the King&#8217;s English. I had been watching with boyish curiosity the play which
	had just concluded: the mottled, patched, yellowish-green curtain had descended
	upon the personages whose sorrows were my own; and I was gazing vacantly at the
	long row of tallow candles placed in holes bored for the purpose in the stage,
	and at the two fiddlers who composed &#8216;the orchestra,&#8217; and who were
	reconnoitering the house. Presently a small bell was rung, with a jerk. There
	was a flourish or two from &#8216;the orchestra;&#8217; another tinkle of the bell; and up
	rose the faded drapery. An interval of a moment succeeded, during which half of
	a large mountain was removed from the scenery, and a piece of forest shoved up
	to the ambitious wood that had been aspiring to overtop the Alps. At length a
	young lady, whom I had just seen butchered in a most horrid manner by a villain,
	came from the side of the stage with a smile, which, while it displayed her
	white teeth, wrought the rouge upon her face into very perceptible corrugations,
	and made a lowly courtesy. She walked with measured step three or four times
	across the stage, in the full blaze of the flaring candles, smiling again, and
	hemming, to clear her voice. Presently a perfect stillness prevailed; &#8216;awed
	Consumption checked his chided cough;&#8217; every urchin suspended his cat-call; and
	&#8216;the boldest held his breath for a time.&#8217; Our vocalist looked at the leader of
	the orchestra and his fellow-fiddlers, and commenced, in harmony with their
	instruments. How touching was that song! I shall never have my soul so enrapt
	again. That <em>freshness</em> of young admiration possessed my spirit which can come
	but once. The air was &#8216;<i>The Braes of Balquither</i>,&#8217; a charming melody, meetly
	wedded to the noble lines of <span class="special_name">Tannehill</span>; and
	<span class="pagenum"><a id="page193" name="page193"></a>193</span>enthusiasm
	was at its height when the singer had concluded the following stanza, almost
	sublime in its picturesque beauty:</p>


	<div class="poem">
	<div class="stanza">
	<p>&#8216;When the rude wintry wind wildly raves round our dwelling,</p>
	<p>And the roar of the lion on the night-breeze is swelling,</p>
	<p>Then so merrily we&#8217;ll sing, while the storm rattles o&#8217;er us,</p>
	<p>Till the dear shealing ring with the light-lilting chorus!&#8217;</p>
	</div>
	</div>

	<p>The air was old as the hills, but like all Scottish melodies, as lasting too. To
	every body the songs of Scotland are grateful; and the universal attachment to
	them arises from their beautiful simplicity, deep pathos, and unaffected,
	untrammelled melody. The romantic sway of the songs of Scotland over her sons
	when &#8216;far awa&#8217; is to me no marvel. If they possess the power to thrill or to
	subdue the hearts of those who have never stepped upon the soil of that glorious
	country, is it at all surprising that they should exert a powerful influence
	over the native-born, who associate those airs with the purple heath, the blue
	loch, the hazy mountain-top, and the valley sleeping below?</p>

	<div class="poem">
	<div class="stanza">
	<p>&#8216;What sweet tears dim the eyes unshed,</p>
	<p class="i2">What wild vows falter on the tongue,</p>
	<p>When &#8216;Scots wha ha&#8217; wi&#8217; <span class="special_name">Wallace</span> bled,&#8217;</p>
	<p class="i2">Or &#8216;Auld Lang Syne&#8217; is sung!&#8217;</p>
	</div>
	</div>

	<p>The association however is touching, not <em>alone</em> because it awakens old
	recollections, but because the music is <em>natural</em>; it is the language of the
	heart. Affectation has not interpopolated tortuous windings and trills and
	shakes, to mar its beauty, and to clip the full melodious notes of their fair
	proportions. It is pleasant to think that fashion, though never so potent, can
	neither divert nor lessen the popular attachment to the simpler melodies. We
	have the authority of the <span class="special_name">Woods, Wilson, Sinclair,
	Power</span>, and other eminent artists for stating that &#8216;Black-eyed Susan,&#8217;
	&#8216;John Anderson my Jo,&#8217; &#8216;The Last Rose of Summer,&#8217; and kindred airs, could always
	&#8216;bring down the house,&#8217; no matter what the antagonistical musical attraction
	might be. We could wish that the <span class="special_name">Venerable
	Taurus</span>, or &#8216;<span class="special_name">Old Bull</span>,&#8217; as many persons
	call him, would take a hint from this. Let him try it once; and we venture to
	say that no one, however uninitiated, will again retire from his splendid
	performances as a country friend of ours did lately, assigning as a reason: &#8216;I
	waited till about ha&#8217;-past nine; and <em>then</em> he hadn&#8217;t got done <em>tunin&#8217; his
	fiddle</em>!&#8217; A touch of &#8216;music for the general heart&#8217; would have enchained him till
	morning. <span class="special_name">Christopher North</span>, we perceive, in
	the last <span class="special_name">Blackwood</span>, fully enters into the
	spirit of our predilection. He has just returned from a concert of fashionable
	music, where he &#8216;tried to faint, that he might be carried out, but didn&#8217;t know
	how to do it,&#8217; and was compelled to sit with compressed lips, and listen to
	&#8216;sounds from flat shrill signorinas, quavering to distraction,&#8217; for two long
	hours. When he gets <em>home</em>, however, he &#8216;feeds fat his grudge&#8217; against modern
	musical affectations. Let us condense a few of his objurgations:</p>


	<div class="quotation">

	<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">It</span> is a perfect puzzle to us by what process the standard of music has become
	so lowered, as to make what is ordinarily served up under that name be received
	as the legitimate descendant of harmony. There is but one step from the sublime
	to the ridiculous, and this entrancing art, it seems, has taken it; sorely
	dislocating its graceful limbs, and injuring its goodly proportions in the
	unseemly escapade. We hate your crashing, clumsy chords, and utterly spit at and
	defy chromatic passages, from one end of the instrument to the other, and back
	again; flats, sharps, and most appropriate &#8216;naturals,&#8217; spattered all over the
	page. The essential spirit of discord seems to be let loose on our modern music.
	Music to soothe! the idea is obsolete. There is music to excite, much to
	irritate one, and much more to drive a really musical soul stark mad; but none
	to soothe, save that which is drawn from the hiding-places of the past. There is
	no repose, no refreshment to the mind, in our popular compositions. There is to
	us more of touching pathos, heart-thrilling expression, in some of the old
	psalm-tunes, feelingly played, than in a whole batch of modernisms. The strains
	go <em>home</em>, and the &#8216;fountains of the great deep are broken up;&#8217; the great deep
	of unfathomable feeling, that lies far, far below the surface of the
	world-hardened heart; and as the unwonted yet unchecked tear starts to the eye,
	the softened spirit yields to their influence, and shakes off the moil of
	earthly care; rising, purified and spiritualized, into a clearer atmosphere.&#8217;</p>

		<p><span class="first_word">We</span> often hear of odd things happening in consequence of mistakes in orthography,

		seem to prove that it does a man good sometimes to spell somewhat at variance
		with old <span class="special_name">Johnson</span>. In a village not far hence
		lived a man known by the name of <span class="special_name">Broken Jones</span>.
		He had dissipated a large fortune in various law-suits; had become poor and
		crazy; and at last, like another <span class="special_name">Peebles</span>, his
		sole occupation consisted in haunting the courts, lawyers&#8217; offices, and other
		scenes of his misfortunes. To judge and attorneys he was a most incorrigible
		bore; to the latter especially, from whom he was continually soliciting opinions
		on cases which had long been &#8216;settled,&#8217; and carried to the law-ledgers, where
		they were only occasionally hunted up as precedents in the suit of perhaps some
		other destined victims. As <span class="special_name">Jones</span> hadn&#8217;t a cent
		of money left, it was of course impossible for him to obtain any more
		&#8216;opinions;&#8217; but this didn&#8217;t cure him of his law-mania. One morning he entered
		the office of lawyer <span class="keep_together">D&#8212;&#8212;</span>, in a more excited state than he had exhibited for a
		long time, and seating himself <i>vis-a-vis</i> with <em>his</em> victim, requested his
		&#8216;opinion&#8217; on one of the &#8216;foregone conclusions&#8217; already mentioned. <span class="keep_together">D&#8212;&#8212;</span>
		happening at the moment to be very busy, endeavored to get rid of his visiter,
		and contrived various expedients for that purpose. But <span
		class="special_name">Jones</span> was not in a mood to be trifled with. &#8216;I came,
		&#8216;Squire,&#8217; said he, &#8216;to get your opinion in writing on this case, and I will have
		it before I leave the room, if I sit here till the day of judgment!&#8217; The lawyer
		looked upon his visiter, while a thought of forcible ejectment passed through
		his brain; but the glaring eye and stout athletic frame which met his gaze, told
		him that such a course would be extremely hazardous. At length the dinner-bell
		rang. A bright thought struck him; and putting on his coat and hat, he took
		<span class="special_name">Jones</span> gently by the arm: &#8216;Come,&#8217; said he, &#8216;go
		and dine with me.&#8217; &#8216;No!&#8217; said the latter, fiercely; &#8216;I&#8217;ll never dine again until
		I get what I came for.&#8217; The lawyer was in a quandary, and at length, in very
		despair, he consented to forego his dinner and give his annoyer the desired
		opinion. &#8216;Well, well, <span class="special_name">Jones</span>,&#8217; said he,
		soothingly, &#8216;you shall have it;&#8217; and gathering pens, ink and paper, he was soon
		seated at the table, while <span class="special_name">Jones</span>, creeping on
		tiptoe across the room, stood peeping over his shoulder. The lawyer commenced:
		&#8216;My oppinion in the <span class="keep_together">case&#8212;&#8212;&#8217;</span> &#8216;Humph!&#8217; said the lunatic, suddenly seizing his

		have been not a little interested in the articles on <i>Mind and Instinct</i>, in
		late numbers of this Magazine. A valued friend writing from Maryland, observes:
		&#8216;The collection of facts by your contributor is very industrious, their array
		quite skilful, and the argument very strong. I think, however, that if I had
		time I could pick several flaws in the reasoning, or rather erect a very good
		counter-argument, founded principally upon the fact that the intelligence of
		animals is generally as great in early youth as it is in the prime of their
		beasthood. The author might have added to his list of facts, an account which I
		read when a boy, of the practice of the baboons in Caffraria, near the
		orange-orchards. They arrange themselves in a row from their dens to the
		orange-trees. One then ascends the tree, plucks the oranges, and throws them to
		the next baboon, and he to the next, and so on throughout the whole file; they
		standing some fifty yards apart. In this manner they quickly strip a tree, and
		at the same time are safe from being all surprised at once. The early French
		missionaries in Canada, also asserted that the squirrels of that region, having
		denuded the country on one side of the big lake, of nuts, used to take pieces of
		birch bark, and hoisting their tails for canvass, float to the other side for
		their supply.&#8217; We have been struck with a passage in a powerful article upon
		&#8216;<i>The Hope that is within Us</i>,&#8217; in a late foreign periodical, wherein the
		fruitful theme of our correspondent is touched upon. &#8216;If matter,&#8217; says the
		writer, &#8216;be incapable of consciousness, as <span
		class="special_name">Johnson</span> so powerfully argues in <i>Rasselas</i>, then the
		<i>animus</i> of brutes must be an <i>anima</i>, and immaterial; for the dog and the
		elephant not merely exhibit &#8216;consciousness,&#8217; but a &#8216;half-reasoning&#8217; power. And
		if it be true, as <span class="special_name">Johnson</span> maintains, that
		immateriality of necessity produces immortality, then the poor Indian&#8217;s
		conclusion is the most logical,</p>

	<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page195" name="page195"></a>195</span>The truth is,
	that we must depend upon <em>revelation</em> for an assurance of immortality; which
	promises, however, the resurrection of the body, as philosophy is unequal to its
	demonstration, and modern researches into animal life have rendered the proof
	more difficult than heretofore.&#8217; By the by, &#8216;speaking of animals:&#8217; there is a
	letter from <span class="special_name">Lemuel Gulliver</span> in the last number
	of <span class="special_name">Blackwood</span>, describing a meeting of
	&#8216;delegates from the different classes of consumers of <em>oats</em>, held at the
	Nag&#8217;s-Head inn at Horsham.&#8217; The business of the meeting was opened by a young
	<span class="special_name">Racer</span>, who expressed his desire to promote the
	interests of the horse-community, and to promote any measure which might
	contribute to the increase of the consumption of oats, and improve the condition
	of his fellow quadrupeds. He considered the horse-interest greatly promoted by
	the practice of sowing wild oats, which he warmly commended. A <span
	class="special_name">Hackney-coach Horse</span> declared himself in favor of the
	<em>sliding-scale</em>, which he understood to mean the wooden pavement. Things went
	much more smoothly wherever it was established. He contended for the abolition
	of nose-bags, which he designated as an intolerable nuisance; urged the
	prohibition of chaff with oats, as unfit for the use of able-bodied horses; and
	indeed evinced the truth of his professions, that he &#8216;yielded to no horse in an
	anxious desire to promote the true interests of the horse-community.&#8217; An <span
	class="special_name">Old English Hunter</span> impressed upon the young
	delegates the good old adage of &#8216;Look before you leap,&#8217; and urged them to go for
	&#8216;measures, not men.&#8217; <span class="special_name">A Stage Horse</span> &#8216;congratulated the community upon
	the abolition of bearing-reins, those grievous burdens upon the necks of all
	free-going horses; and he trusted the time would soon arrive when the blinkers
	would also be taken off, every corn-bin thrown open, and every horse his own
	leader.&#8217; Several other steeds, in the various ranks of horse-society, addressed
	the meeting. &#8216;Resolutions, drawn by two <span
	class="special_name">Dray-Horses</span>, embodying the supposed grievances of
	the community, were finally agreed upon, and a petition, under the hoof of the
	president, founded upon them, having been prepared and ordered to be presented
	to the House of Commons by the members for Horsham, the meeting separated, and
	the delegates returned to their respective stables.&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">What</span> habitual theatre

	swimming in light, that will &#8216;come the married woman&#8217;s eye&#8217; over a kind but most
	antiquarian husband, when the following is read, some two weeks from now, in
	their &#8216;little parlor&#8217; in a town of the far west. It reaches us in the <span
	class="small_all_caps">MS.</span> of a Boston friend: &#8216;Old Colonel <span class="keep_together">W&#8212;&#8212;</span>, formerly
	a well-known character in one of our eastern cities, was remarkable for but one
	passion out of the ordinary range of humanity, and that was for buying at
	auction any little lot of trumpery which came under the head of &#8216;miscellaneous,&#8217;
	for the reason that it couldn&#8217;t be classified. Though close-fisted in general,
	he was continually throwing away his money by fives and tens upon such trash. In
	this way he had filled all the odd corners in his dwelling and out-houses with a
	collection of nondescript articles, that would have puzzled a philosopher to
	tell what they were made for, or to what use they could ever be put. This
	however, was but a secondary consideration with the Colonel; for he seldom
	troubled his head about such articles after they were once fairly housed. Not so
	with his wife however, who was continually remonstrating against these
	purchases, which served only to clutter up the house, and as food for the mirth
	of the domestics. But the Colonel, though he often submitted to these
	remonstrances of his better-half, couldn&#8217;t resist his passion; and so he went on
	adding from week to week to his heap of miscellanies. One day while sauntering
	down the street, he heard the full, rich tones of his friend <span class="keep_together">C&#8212;&#8212;</span>, the
	well-known auctioneer, and as a matter of course stepped in to see what was
	being sold. On the floor he observed a collection that looked as if it might
	have been purloined from the garret of some museum, and around which a motley
	group was assembled; while on the counter stood the portly auctioneer, in the
	very height of a mock-indignant remonstrance with his audience. &#8216;Nine dollars
	and ninety cents!&#8217; cried the auctioneer. &#8216;Gentlemen, it is a shame, it is
	barbarous, to stand by and permit such a sacrifice of property! Nine dol-<em>lars</em>
	and <span class="keep_together">ninety&#8212;&#8212;</span> Good morning, Colonel! A magnificent lot of&#8212;of&#8212;<em>antiques</em>&#8212;and
	all going for nine dollars and ninety cents. Gentlemen, you&#8217;ll never see another
	such lot; and all going&#8212;going&#8212;for nine dollars and ninety cents. Colonel
	<span class="keep_together">W&#8212;&#8212;</span>, can <em>you</em> permit such a sacrifice?&#8217; The Colonel glanced his eye over the
	lot, and then with a nod and a wink assured him he could not. The next instant
	the hammer came down, and the purchase was the Colonel&#8217;s, at ten dollars. As the
	articles were to be paid for and removed immediately, the Colonel lost no time
	in getting a cart, and having seen every thing packed up and on their way to his
	house, he proceeded to his own store, chuckling within himself that <em>now</em> at
	least he had made a bargain at which even his wife couldn&#8217;t grumble. In due time
	he was seated at the dinner-table, when lifting his eyes, he observed a cloud
	upon his wife&#8217;s brow. &#8216;Well, my dear?&#8217; said he, inquiringly. &#8216;Well?&#8217; repeated
	his wife; &#8216;it is <span class="pagenum"><a id="page197"
	name="page197"></a>197</span><em>not</em> well, Mr. W.; I am vexed beyond endurance.
	You know <span class="keep_together">C&#8212;&#8212;</span>, the auctioneer?&#8217; &#8216;Certainly,&#8217; replied the Colonel; &#8216;and a very
	gentlemanly person he is <em>too</em>.&#8217; &#8216;<em>You</em> may think so,&#8217; rejoined the wife, &#8216;but I
	<em>don&#8217;t</em>, and I&#8217;ll tell you why. A few days ago I gathered together all the
	trumpery with which you have been cluttering up the house for the last
	twelve-month, and sent it to Mr. <span class="keep_together">C&#8212;&#8212;</span>, with orders to sell the lot immediately

	at farthest, and pay over the proceeds to my order. And here I&#8217;ve been
	congratulating myself on two things: first, on having got rid of a most
	intolerable nuisance; and secondly, on receiving money enough therefor to
	purchase that new velvet hat you promised me so long ago. And now what do you
	think? This morning, about an hour ago, <em>the whole load came back again, without
	a word of explanation</em>!&#8217; The Colonel looked blank for a moment, and then
	proceeded to clear up the mystery. But the good <span
	class="special_name">vrouw</span> was pacified only by the promise of a
	ten-dollar note beside that in the hands of the auctioneer; on condition,
	however, that she should never mention it.&#8217; Of course she kept her word! <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span>

	<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">Our</span> Ancient,&#8217; the editor of the handsome
	&#8216;Lady&#8217;s and Gentleman&#8217;s Magazine&#8217; hight &#8216;<i>The Columbian</i>,&#8217; (which is to run a
	brisk competition, as we learn, with the other &#8216;pictorials,&#8217; <span
	class="special_name">Godey&#8217;s</span>, <span class="special_name">Graham&#8217;s</span>, and <span
	class="special_name">Snowden&#8217;s</span>,) should have enabled us to speak of it
	from an examination of <em>our own copy</em>, instead of being obliged to filch an idea
	of its merits from the counter of those most obliging gentlemen, Messrs. <span
	class="special_name">Burgess and Stringer</span>. The work is a gay one
	externally, and spirited internally; having several good articles from good
	writers, male and female. One of the best things in it, however, is the paper on
	&#8216;<i>Magazine Literature</i>,&#8217; by the Editor. How many writers, now well known both at
	home and abroad, who began and continue their literary career in the <span
	class="special_name">Knickerbocker</span>, can bear testimony to the truth of
	the following remarks:</p>



	<div class="quotation">

	<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">We</span> have said that this is the age of
	magazines; adverting not merely to their number, but even more especially to
	their excellence. They are the field, chiefly, in which literary reputation is
	won. Who ever thinks of <span class="special_name">John Wilson</span> as the
	learned professor, or as the author of bound volumes? Who does not, when <span
	class="special_name">Wilson&#8217;s</span> name is mentioned, instantly call to mind
	the splendid article-writer, the <span class="special_name">Christopher
	North</span> of Blackwood? <span class="special_name">Charles Lamb</span> was
	long known only as the <span class="special_name">Elia</span> of the New
	Monthly. Most of the modern French celebrities; <span class="special_name">Sue</span>,
	<span class="special_name">Janin</span>, and half a hundred others, have made their fame in the
	<i>feuilletons</i> of the Parisian journals; a more decided graft, by the way, than
	is elsewhere seen, of the magazine upon the newspaper. In our own country, how
	many there are whose names are known from the St. Lawrence to the Gulf of
	Mexico, that are as yet innocent of books, but have nevertheless contributed
	largely and well to the growing stock of American literature. How many more who
	are bringing themselves into notice by their monthly efforts in the pages of
	some popular magazine. In fact, the magazine is the true channel into which
	talent should direct itself for the acquisition of literary fame. The newspaper
	is too ephemeral; the book is not of sufficiently rapid and frequent production.
	The monthly magazine just hits the happy medium, enabling the <span
	class="pagenum"><a id="page198" name="page198"></a>198</span>writer to present
	himself twelve times a year before a host of readers, in whose memories he is
	thus kept fresh, yet allowing him space enough to develope his thought, and time
	enough to do his talent justice in each article. Then, too, on the score of
	emolument, justly recognised now as a very essential matter, and legitimately
	entitled to grave consideration, the magazine offers advantages not within the
	reach of either book or newspaper. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">But</span> after all, the great point is, that
	magazines are more read than any other kind of publications. They just adapt
	themselves to the leisure of the business man, and the taste of the idler; to
	the spare half hours of the notable housewife and the languid inertia of the
	fashionable lady. They can be dropped into a valise or a carpet-bag as a welcome
	provision for the wants of a journey by steam-boat or rail-road, when the
	country through which the traveller passes offers nothing attractive to be seen,
	or the eyes are weary of seeing; they while away delightfully the tedious hours
	of a rainy day in summer, and afford the most pleasant occupation through the
	long evenings of winter.&#8217;</p>

	</div>


	<p>Touching the matter of payment for magazine articles: Mr. <span
	class="special_name">Willis</span> informs us that many of the American
	magazines pay to their more eminent contributors nearly three times the amount
	for a printed page that is paid by English magazines to the best writers in
	Great-Britain; and he instances <span class="special_name">Godey</span> and
	<span class="special_name">Graham</span> as paying often twelve dollars a page
	to their principal contributors. This refers to <em>a few</em> &#8216;principal&#8217; writers
	only, as we have good reason to know, having been instrumental in sending
	several acceptable correspondents to those publications, who have received
	scarcely one-fourth of the sum mentioned. Mr. <span
	class="special_name">Willis</span> adds, however, that many good writers write
	for nothing, and that &#8216;the number of clever writers has increased so much that
	there are thousands who can get no article accepted.&#8217; All this is quite true.
	There is no magazine in America that has paid so large sums to distinguished
	native writers as the <span class="special_name">Knickerbocker</span>. Indeed,
	our <em>most</em> distinguished American writer was never a contributor to any other of
	our Monthlys than this. The books of this Magazine show, that independent of the
	Editor&#8217;s division of its profits as joint proprietor, or his salary as editor,
	(a matter which its publishers have always kept distinct from, and in all
	respects unconnected with, the payments to contributors,) annual sums have
	heretofore been paid for literary <i>matériel</i> greater than the most liberal
	estimate we have seen of any annual literary payment by our widely-circulated
	contemporaries. To the first poet in America, (not to say in the world, at this
	moment,) we have repeatedly paid fifty dollars for a single poem, not exceeding,
	in any instance, two pages in length; and the cost of prose papers from sources
	of kindred eminence has in many numbers exceeded fifteen dollars a page. Again:
	we have in several instances paid twice as much for the MS. of a continuous
	novel in these pages as the writer could obtain of any metropolitan
	book-publisher; and after appearing in volumes, it has been found that the wide
	publicity given to the work by the <span
	class="special_name">Knickerbocker</span> has been of greatest service to its
	popularity, in more than one subsequent edition. We should add, however, that we
	have had no lack, at any period, of excellent articles for our work at moderate
	prices; while many of our more popular papers have been entirely gratuitous,
	unless indeed the writers consider the honorable reputation which they have
	established in these pages as <em>some</em> reward for intellectual exertion. But
	&#8216;something too much of this.&#8217; We close with a word touching the pictorial
	features of the &#8216;<i>Columbian</i>.&#8217; It has four &#8216;plates&#8217; proper, with an engraving of
	the fashions; is neatly executed by Messrs. <span class="special_name">Hopkins
	and Jennings</span>, and published by <span class="special_name">Israel
	Post</span>, Number Three, Astor-House. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">Saint
	Valentine&#8217;s Day</span> is just at hand; and a pleasant correspondent, in
	enclosing us the following lines, begs us to mention the fact, and to refer to
	the festivities of the day. We know of <em>one</em> &#8216;festivity&#8217; that will be a very
	<i>recherché</i> and brilliant affair, on the evening of that day; namely, &#8216;<i>The
	Bachelors&#8217; Ball</i>,&#8217; to be given with unwonted splendor at the Astor-House, under
	the supervision of accomplished managers, whose taste and liberality have
	already been abundantly tested. &#8216;Take it as a matter granted,&#8217; says our friend,
	&#8216;that very many of your lady-readers will commit matrimony before the year is
	done; and tell them so plainly; for it will gratify their palpitating hearts;
	and even should it not be true in every individual case, the disappointed ones
	will never complain of you for the pleasing delusion; for it was their own
	fault, of course, not yours. It behooves you, moreover, as a conservator of the
	general weal, to give the young wives that are to be some goodly counsel; and to
	aid you in the laudable office of advice-giver, I send you some appropriate
	verses, which some fifteen <span class="pagenum"><a id="page199"
	name="page199"></a>199</span>years ago went the rounds of the press, and met
	with &#8216;acceptance bounteous.&#8217; The moral of the stanzas, I take it, is
	unexceptionable, whatever may be said of their execution:&#8217;</p>

		<p><span class="first_word">Through</span> the kindness of Messrs. <span class="special_name">Mason and
		Tuttle</span>, Nassau-street, (who import the <em>originals</em> for immediate
		circulation to American subscribers,) we have our copies of the foreign
		Monthlys, as well as of the &#8216;Edinburgh,&#8217; &#8216;Foreign,&#8217; and &#8216;Quarterly&#8217; Reviews for
		the current quarter. The &#8216;Quarterly, so savage and tartarly,&#8217; has a notice of
		the &#8216;<i>Change for American Notes</i>,&#8217; which is not conceived in the kindest spirit
		toward this country. It reviews <span class="special_name">Prescott&#8217;s</span>
		late work, however, at great length, and welcomes it with cordial commendation.
		Among other &#8216;good words,&#8217; the reviewer observes: &#8216;He is full and copious,
		without being prolix and wearisome; his narrative is flowing and spirited,
		sometimes very picturesque; his style is pure, sound English.&#8217; In conclusion,
		the reviewer says: &#8216;We close with expressing our satisfaction that Mr. <span
		class="special_name">Prescott</span> has given us an opportunity at this time of
		showing our deep sympathy, the sympathy of kindred and of blood, with Americans
		who like himself do honor to our common literature. Mr. <span
		class="special_name">Prescott</span> may take his place among the real good
		English writers of history in modern times.&#8217; The &#8216;Foreign Quarterly&#8217; opens with
		a paper upon &#8216;<i>The Poets and Poetry of America</i>,&#8217; ostensibly based upon Mr.
		<span class="special_name">Griswold&#8217;s</span> book. It is not altogether a
		review, however, but a very coarse and evidently malignant tirade against
		America, her people, institutions, manners, customs, literature; every thing, in
		short, that she is and that she contains. We annex a hasty synopsis of the
		<em>critical</em> portion of the article in question. <span
		class="special_name">Halleck</span> is &#8216;praised, and that highly too.&#8217; His
		&#8216;Marco Bozzaris&#8217; is pronounced &#8216;a master-piece,&#8217; and the &#8216;most perfect specimen
		of versification in American literature;&#8217; and himself as possessing &#8216;a complete
		knowledge of the musical mysteries of his art.&#8217; A quotation is made, with much
		laud, from his &#8216;<span class="special_name">Red-Jacket</span>,&#8217; but the lines are
		spoiled by two gross errors; one in the last line <span class="pagenum"><a
		id="page200" name="page200"></a>200</span>of the third, and the other in the
		first line of the fifth stanza. The highest encomiums are justly bestowed upon
		<span class="special_name">Bryant</span>, as a &#8216;purely American poet,&#8217; who
		&#8216;treats the works of Nature with a religious solemnity, and brings to the
		contemplation of her grandest relations a pure and serious spirit. His poetry is
		reflective but not sad; grave in its depths but brightened in its flow by the
		sunshine of the imagination. He never paints on gauze; he is always earnest,
		always poetical; his manner is every where graceful and unaffected.&#8217; The
		illustrative quotation is from &#8216;An Evening Reverie,&#8217; written by Mr. <span
		class="special_name">Bryant</span> for the <span
		class="special_name">Knickerbocker</span>. <span class="special_name">Longfellow</span> is pronounced to be
		&#8216;unquestionably the first of American poets; the most thoughtful and chaste; the
		most elaborate and finished. His poems are distinguished by severe intellectual
		beauty, by dulcet sweetness of expression, a wise and hopeful spirit, and a
		complete command over every variety of rhythm. They are neither numerous nor
		long, but of that compact texture which will last for posterity.&#8217; <span
		class="special_name">Sprague</span> is represented as having in certain of his
		poems imitated <span class="special_name">Shakspeare</span> and <span
		class="special_name">Collins</span> rather too closely for all three to be
		original. &#8216;<span class="special_name">Pierpont</span> is crowded with
		coincidences which look very like <em>plagiarisms</em>;&#8217; &#8216;but,&#8217; adds the reviewer, &#8216;it
		is reserved for <span class="special_name">Charles Fenno Hoffman</span> to distance all plagiarists of
		ancient and modern times in the enormity and openness of his thefts. He is <span
		class="special_name">Moore</span> hocused for the American market. His songs are
		<i>rifaciamentos</i>. The turns of the melody, the flowing of the images, the
		scintillating conceits, are all <span class="special_name">Moore</span>.
		Sometimes he steals his very words.&#8217; Mrs. <span
		class="special_name">Sigourney&#8217;s</span> poetry is said to be characterized by
		&#8216;feeble verbosity&#8217; and &#8216;lady-like inanity,&#8217; and Mrs. <span
		class="special_name">Osgood</span> is represented as being in the same category.
		After quoting certain characteristic lines of Mr. <span
		class="special_name">John Neal</span>, describing the eye of a poet as &#8216;<em>brimful
		of water and light</em>,&#8217; and his forehead as being &#8216;<em>alarmingly bright</em>,&#8217; the
		reviewer adds: &#8216;We find a pleasant relief from these distressing hallucinations,
		in the poems of <span class="special_name">Alfred B. Street</span>. He is a
		descriptive poet, and at the head of his class. His pictures of American scenery
		are full of <em>gusto</em> and freshness; sometimes too wild and diffuse, but always
		true and beautiful.&#8217; So some are praised and some are blamed&#8212;&#8216;thus runs the
		world away!&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">We</span> are made aware, and we
		would not have our correspondents ignorant of the fact, that there is a critical
		eye monthly upon our pages, that is keen to discover errors (as well as
		beauties) in language and construction of sentences. See: &#8216;By the by, what a
		miserable language is our English in some respects; so awkward, so incompact!
		Look at the phrase &#8216;unheard of,&#8217; and compare it with the Latin &#8216;<i>inauditus</i>.&#8217;
		What a pity we were not born Romans or Greeks, with Yankee notions! Tell your
		Gotham friends that if they are speaking of a ruinous <em>brick</em> wall, they must
		say <i>dilaterated</i>, from &#8216;later,&#8217; a brick, and not &#8216;<i>dilapidated</i>,&#8217; from &#8216;lapis,&#8217;
		a stone. One might as well say a man is &#8216;stoned&#8217; to death with brick-bats.&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span>
		<span class="first_word">What</span> sad and startling contrasts are
		presented to the eye and mind of one who attentively looks over the illustrated
		newspapers of the British metropolis! On one hand, pictures of triumphal
		processions, arches, bonfires, illuminations, rich presents, gorgeous equipages,
		state-beds, &#8216;royal poultry-houses, owleries, and pigeonries,&#8217; accompanied by
		elaborate descriptions, arrest the attention; on the other, there is a picture
		of a city &#8216;Asylum for the Destitute,&#8217; where poor naked wretches find a temporary
		refuge from the pitiless winter storm without: huddling round a dim fire, or
		sunk exhausted upon the straw in the human &#8216;stalls,&#8217; or clutching at their bowls
		of pauper-soup; a scene whose true character is enforced by accounts of poor
		women making shirts for <em>a farthing apiece</em>, a hard day&#8217;s work; sleeping four in
		a bed; purchasing with the scanty pittance tea-leaves to boil over again!
		Hardly-entreated brothers and sisters of humanity! not always shall the glaring
		inequality that surrounds you, crush your spirits to the earth! <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span
		class="first_word">There</span> is a pleasant pen in our metropolitan
		&#8216;<i>Aurora</i>,&#8217; which occasionally dashes off sententious paragraphs that flash and
		sparkle like snow-crust in a moon-lit night in winter. There is evidently a
		<span class="special_name">Foster</span>-ing hand over its columns; and
		<em>through</em> them (let us add, as it is <em>that</em> of which we especially wish to
		speak,) over the reputation of Mr. <span class="special_name">Willis</span>. The
		remarks in a late number of that journal, under the head of &#8216;<em>Mr. Willis&#8217;s
		Defence</em>&#8217; against a scurrilous attack on his private character in a down-eastern
		print, were equally just and felicitous. Had it been generally <span
		class="pagenum"><a id="page201" name="page201"></a>201</span>known in his native
		town who was the instigator of that attack, we have good authority for saying
		that, gross as it was, Mr. <span class="special_name">Willis</span> would have
		considered it utterly beneath his notice. As it was, however, he deemed it not
		amiss at one and the same time to punish skulking envy and impotent malignity;
		to vindicate his reputation with his townsmen against unprovoked calumny; and to
		render the repetition of any obnoxious remarks from the same source altogether
		&#8216;of none effect&#8217; and unworthy of heed. This he accomplished by his &#8216;Defence&#8217; and
		the &#8216;terrors of the law,&#8217; which speedily produced a satisfactory sample of
		wholesale word-eating. <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">Of</span> all the Polichinellos we have ever encountered,
		we consider &#8216;<i>Punch, or the London Charivari</i>,&#8217; the best. His fun is

		class="special_name">Ennui</span>. &#8216;Laughter,&#8217; he tells us, &#8216;is a divine
		faculty. It is one of the few, nay, the only one redeeming grace in that
		thunder-cased, profligate old scoundrel <span
		class="special_name">Jupiter</span>, that he sometimes laughs: he is saved from
		the disgust of all respectable people by the amenity of a broad grin.&#8217; We
		ourselves hold with the pleasant <span class="special_name">Lincoln
		Ramble</span>: &#8216;I love a hearty laugh; I love to <em>hear</em> a hearty laugh above all
		other sounds. It is the music of the heart; the thrills of those chords which
		vibrate from no bad touch; the language Heaven has given us to carry on the
		exchange of sincere and disinterested sympathies.&#8217; And to the end that &#8216;laughter
		free and silvery from the heart may escape the reader, doing rightful honor to
		<span class="special_name">Punch</span>, and bestowing cheerfulness and health
		upon the laughter,&#8217; we proceed to present a few excerpta which arrested our
		attention in looking over late files. We suspect that the annexed report of the
		&#8216;doings of Royalty&#8217; in the country have more than once had a precedent. <span
		class="special_name">Prince Albert</span> is here at Dayton-Manor, the seat of
		Sir <span class="special_name">Robert Peel</span>: &#8216;Her Majesty slept extremely
		well; but whether it was the air of Dayton, or the conversation of the host, did
		not transpire. At eleven o&#8217;clock in the morning, Prince Albert went out to
		shoot. The guns were ordered at ten and the game was desired to be in attendance
		at half-past. The Prince first went in a boat on the water, where several ducks
		were appointed to be in waiting. Having granted an audience to the whole of
		them, and unintentionally honored two by shooting them, though it was another
		duck who had the distinguished gratification of being aimed at and missed, his
		Royal Highness landed. A numerous meeting of hares and pheasants having been
		called to pay their respects to the Prince, the game-keepers forming an outer
		circle, with their guns pointed to keep the game well up to the mark, His Royal
		Highness shot sixty pheasants, twenty-five head of hares, eight rabbits and one
		wood-cock, who would cock his bill opposite the muzzle of Royalty.&#8217; The poetical
		advertisement of one <span class="special_name">Moses</span>, a slop-shop
		clothes-man, is pleasantly &#8216;reviewed.&#8217; Of his &#8216;Prince <span
		class="special_name">Albert</span> coats,&#8217; <span
		class="special_name">Punch</span> says: &#8216;Whatever may be the resemblance between
		the Prince and the coat, the similarity certainly ends with the price; one
		costing thirty shillings and the other thirty thousand pounds per annum.&#8217; Here
		is a touch at Moses&#8217; sea-coats:</p>


		<div class="poem">
			<div class="stanza">
				<p>&#8216;These coats for nautical pursuits</p>
				<p>Have qualities no one disputes;</p>
				<p>The very texture of their cloth</p>
				<p>Seems to defy the ocean&#8217;s wrath:</p>
				<p>And then their form and make as well</p>
				<p>Are suited to the billows&#8217; swell.&#8217;</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<p>What can be happier than the allusion to the fact mentioned in the last two
		lines; namely, that the coat is quite a match for the billows, being as great a
		swell as any of them? The poet dashes off a few lines on trowsers, finishing
		with the following couplet, which is not likely to encourage purchasers. It is
		stated, and we dare say truly, that if any one puts on a pair of <span
		class="special_name">Moses&#8217;</span> trowsers he becomes at once an object of
		general observation:</p>


		<div class="poem">
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>&#8216;While oft such cries as these escape;</p>
		<p>Look! there&#8217;s a figure! there&#8217;s a shape!&#8217;</p>
		</div>
		</div>

	<p>It is a very natural consequence, no doubt, of disporting one&#8217;s-self in
	doe-skins made for seven-pence a pair; but the cries of &#8216;There&#8217;s a figure!
	there&#8217;s a shape!&#8217; must make the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page202"
	name="page202"></a>202</span>trowsers rather dear to any one who wishes to walk
	about peaceably, unmolested by this species of street-criticism.&#8217; Under the head
	of &#8216;Bolsters for Behindhand Botanists,&#8217; we find these original questions and
	answers: &#8216;What are the most difficult roots to extract from the ground?&#8217; The
	cube-root. &#8216;What is the pistil of a flower?&#8217; It is that instrument with which
	the flower shoots. &#8216;What is meant by the word stamina?&#8217; It means the pluck or
	courage which enables the flower to shoot.&#8217; &#8216;The reversionary interest of a
	life-crossing, with retail lucifer business attached,&#8217; is offered by a
	street-sweeper near the Bank of England, he having &#8216;prigged vat vasn&#8217;t his&#8217;n,
	and gone to pris&#8217;n.&#8217; &#8216;He effected an irregular transfer at the bank one day,
	which, whatever his doubts upon the subject might previously have been, led to
	his ultimate conviction.&#8217; The &#8216;Comic <span
	class="special_name">Blackstone</span>&#8217; enlightens us upon one of the &#8216;King&#8217;s
	prerogatives&#8217;: &#8216;The King is the fountain of justice, from which are supplied all
	the leaden reservoirs in Westminster-Hall, and the pumps at the inferior
	tribunals.&#8217; Among the public inquiries is the following: &#8216;At a crowded meeting
	at Islington, on the question of granting a theatrical license, the papers state
	that the judges declined at first, but upon the urgent appeal of an advocate,
	&#8216;<em>the bench gave way</em>.&#8217; Are we to understand from this that the opposition fell
	to the ground?&#8217; In &#8216;<span class="special_name">Punch&#8217;s</span> Almanac&#8217; for 1844,
	we find among other side-remarks, the annexed: under May seventh:
	&#8216;<span class="special_name">Washington Irving</span> on his way to Madrid as American Ambassador, is
	entertained in London, 1842. America takes the hand of Spain, and puts her best
	<em>pen</em> into it.&#8217; &#8216;June sixth: The first cargo of ice comes from America, 1843,
	for the relief of those who had burnt their fingers with Pennsylvania bonds.&#8217;
	&#8216;Time is money; but it doesn&#8217;t follow that man is a capitalist who has a great
	quantity of it on his hands.&#8217; <span class="special_name">Punch&#8217;s</span>
	&#8216;Literary Intelligence&#8217; is very full. From it we gather that the author of the
	&#8216;Mothers,&#8217; &#8216;Wives,&#8217; &#8216;Maids,&#8217; and &#8216;Daughters&#8217; of England has another work in
	press, entitled &#8216;<i>The Grandmothers of England</i>.&#8217; &#8216;No grandmother&#8217;s education
	will be complete till she has read and re-read &#8216;The Grandmothers of England.&#8217;
	The book is the very best guide to oval suction extant.&#8217; So says an &#8216;<i>Evening
	Paper</i>.&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">We</span> should be glad to be informed of <em>the name</em> of any real or

	of the most entertaining weekly journals on this continent, who could ask <em>more</em>
	than is offered by the &#8216;<i>Spirit of the Times</i>&#8217; to all new subscribers to that
	widely-popular sheet; being no less than any five of those fine large quarto

	Monarch, Leviathan, Argyle, Black-Maria, Grey-Eagle, Shark, Hedgeford, John
	Bascombe, and Monmouth-Eclipse. On the second day of March a new volume
	commences; when we hope that this accredited organ of the sporting world, which
	has raised the prices of blood-stock in this country beyond all precedent, and
	which in its literary and dramatic departments is without a rival in this or any
	other country, will take a long lease of a healthful existence, and go on
	&#8216;prospering and to prosper.&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">The</span> reader will be amused we think with the
	&#8216;<i>Veritable Sea-Story</i>,&#8217; told by our friend <span class="special_name">Harry
	Franco</span>, in a species of poetry run mad, in preceding pages. He writes us:
	&#8216;I send you an epic poem for the <span
	class="special_name">Knickerbocker</span>, founded on facts within my own
	personal experience. I mention this lest you should deem it destitute of merit;
	for it possesses the greatest merit that any human composition can possess;
	namely, truth. And in this respect, if in no other, my poem is beyond dispute
	superior to the Iliad and Paradise Lost. However, tastes differ, I am aware; and
	you may possibly prefer those two epics to mine! They are longer, it is true;
	but then I think it will be conceded, even by the critics of the <span
	class="special_name">Poh</span> school, that my metre is sufficiently long, even
	though my story is short. While others measure their verse by the &#8216;feet,&#8217; I
	measure mine by the yard.&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">D.&#8217;s</span> paper, (of Georgia,) so thickly
	interlarded with French, and Italian synonymes for far more expressive English
	words, reminds us of an old &#8216;ignorant ramus&#8217; in the country, who was always
	eking out his meaning by three or four familiar Latin terms, which he almost
	invariably misapplied. He observed one day to a neighbor, who was speaking
	disrespectfully of a deceased townsman, &#8216;Well, he&#8217;s gone to be judged. <em>E
	pluribus <span class="pagenum"><a id="page203"
	name="page203"></a>203</span>unum</em>&#8212;&#8216;speak no evil of the dead&#8217;&#8212;as the Latin
	proverb says!&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> &#8216;<i>The New World</i>&#8217; enters upon a new year in a very
	beautiful dress, and with renewed attractions in all its internal departments.
	Its large clear types, impressed upon good paper, are exceedingly pleasant to
	the eye, and what they convey to the reader is equally agreeable to the mind
	&#8216;studious of novelty&#8217; and variety. The success which it deserves, we are glad to
	learn it abundantly receives. The &#8216;<i>Brother Jonathan</i>&#8217; has changed proprietors,
	cast its old skin, and comes out as bright and fresh as a June morning. The
	versatile Mrs. <span class="special_name">Ann Stephens</span> (a lady of fine
	intellect, who has produced better prose tales and home-sketches than any one of
	her gifted contemporaries) and Messrs. <span class="special_name">M&#8216;Lachlin and
	Snow</span>, the resident editors of the &#8216;Jonathan,&#8217; discharged their functions
	to due public acceptance; but a name so <em>invariably</em> connected with unsuccessful
	publications that it has come to be justly regarded as the sure precursor and
	inevitable cause of failure, was at the head of the journal as &#8216;principal
	editor;&#8217; and &#8216;down east&#8217; editorial-ings, transmitted by the yard, and endless
	unreadable tales, claiming a kindred paternity, gradually &#8216;choked its wholesome
	growth,&#8217; and finally brought it to a temporary end. The new proprietor however
	has wisely declined this &#8216;principal&#8217; incumbrance; and having secured the
	services of an able editor in the person of <span class="special_name">Henry C.
	Deming</span>, Esq., a gentleman of high literary distinction, and of popular
	correspondents, the journal is already, as we learn, rejoicing in a
	rapidly-enhancing list of subscribers. Success to thee, &#8216;<span
	class="special_name">Brother Jonathan</span>!&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span
	class="first_word">The</span> &#8216;<i>Yankee Trick</i>&#8217; described by our Medford
	(Mass.) correspondent is on file for insertion. It is in <em>one</em> of its features
	not unlike the anecdote of an old official Dutchman in the valley of the Mohawk,
	who one day stopped a Yankee pedler journeying slowly through the valley on the
	Sabbath, and informed him that he must &#8216;put up&#8217; for the day; or &#8216;if it vash
	<em>neshessary</em> dat he should travel, he must pay de fine for de pass.&#8217; It <em>was</em>
	necessary, it seems; for he told the Yankee to write the pass, and he would sign
	it; &#8216;<em>that</em> he could do, though he didn&#8217;t much write, nor read writin&#8217;.&#8217; The
	pass was written and signed with the Dutchman&#8217;s hieroglyphics, and the pedler
	went forth &#8216;into the bowels of the land, without impediment.&#8217; Some six months
	afterward, a brother Dutchman, who kept a &#8216;store&#8217; farther down the Mohawk, in
	&#8216;settling&#8217; with the pious official, brought in, among other accounts, an order
	for twenty-five dollars&#8217; worth of goods. &#8216;How ish dat?&#8217; said the Sunday-officer;
	&#8216;<em>I</em> never give no order; let me see him.&#8217; The order was produced; he put on his
	spectacles and examined it. &#8216;Yaäs, dat ish mine name, sartain&#8212;yaäs; but&#8212;<em>it
	ish dat <span class="keep_together">d&#8212;&#8212;d</span> Yankee pass</em>!&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">Our</span>
	town-readers, many of them, will remember the bird <span
	class="special_name">Mino</span>, who was so fond of chatting in a rich mellow
	voice with the customers at the old Quaker&#8217;s seed-store in Nassau-street. His
	counterpart may at this moment be seen at &#8216;an hostel&#8217; near by; but the
	associations and language of the modern bird are very dissimilar. &#8216;<em>How are
	you?</em>&#8217; is his first salutation; &#8216;<em>do you smoke?</em>&#8217; his next: &#8216;<em>What&#8217;ll you drink?
	Brandy-and water?</em>&#8212;<em>glass o&#8217; wine?</em>&#8217; It has a most whimsical effect, to hear
	such anti-temperance invitations from the bill of a bird, whose bright eye is
	fixed unwinkingly upon you. The Washingtonians should &#8216;look out for him.&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span>
	<span class="first_word">The</span> editor of the <i>Albion</i> has issued to his
	subscribers a very fine large quarto engraving, in mezzo-tint by <span
	class="special_name">Sadd</span>, of <span class="special_name">Heath&#8217;s</span>
	celebrated line-engraving of <span class="special_name">Washington</span>. Its
	size is twenty by twenty-seven inches, and represents the <span
	class="special_name">Pater Patriæ</span> in his most elevated character; that of
	a Chief Magistrate elevated by the free suffrages of his countrymen, after
	having voluntarily laid down his military authority. This print cannot fail to
	be acceptable to every reader of the Albion, unless he shall be too
	narrow-minded to honor true nobleness and dignity of character in one who by
	force of circumstances once stood in a warlike relation to his country. Apropos
	of the &#8216;Albion:&#8217; is our friend the Editor aware that &#8216;<em>The Evening before the
	Wedding</em>,&#8217; published as original in a late issue, was translated for the <span

	journal, to be called &#8216;<span class="special_name">The Exclusive</span>,&#8217; which
	is to be the very antithesis of every thing in the &#8216;cheap and vulgar&#8217; line; no
	slanders, no crim. con.&#8217;s, no horrible accidents; &#8216;no nothing&#8217; of that sort. The
	affair is already creating some excitement among the <i>beau-monde</i>. The reputed
	editors are literary men of the world, who <span class="pagenum"><a id="page204"
	name="page204"></a>204</span>&#8216;know their way.&#8217; Circulars in gold-edged and
	perfumed paper are already flying about. <i>On dit</i>: that the carriers are to be
	dressed in uniform, and deliver the paper in white kid gloves; that pastiles are
	to be kept burning in the publication-office, to disinfect the air of the room
	of ink and damp sheets; and that only those of the first respectability and
	acknowledged standing in gay society, are permitted to subscribe to or receive
	the journal at all! <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">Here</span> is a rich
	specimen of <em>clerical catachresis</em>, which we derive from an eastern
	correspondent: &#8216;Our good dominie gave us on Sunday a sermon on the ocean; its
	wonders, its glories, its beauties; its infinity, its profundity, its
	mightiness, etc., &#8216;But,&#8217; said he, &#8216;what is all this? <em>It is but a drop in the
	bucket of God&#8217;s infinity!</em>&#8217; I wonder what is outside of it!&#8217; <span class="ed_table_break">&bull;&bull;&bull;</span> <span class="first_word">It</span> is not the
	wont of the Editor of this Magazine, as those of its readers who have followed
	us through twenty-two volumes of the <span
	class="special_name">Knickerbocker</span> can bear witness, to trumpet in its
	pages the many kind things that are said of us by the public press; but as a
	fragment is wanted to fill out this page; as we are just at the commencement of
	a new volume; and as we are more than pleased at the cordiality with which the
	first number of it has been received; we shall venture to select from a great
	number of testimonials one or two for insertion here, which are the more
	gratifying, that they evince the regard in which the &#8216;<span
	class="special_name">Old Knick</span>.&#8217; is held at home, and by those who have
	known us the longest and most intimately. The <i>New-York Courier and Enquirer</i>
	says of our last number:</p>


	<div class="quotation">

	<p>&#8216;<span class="first_word">This</span> sterling Monthly is always punctual to a
	day in its issues, promptly appearing with the dawn of the month, though our
	notices of it frequently lag sadly behind it. It is yet, however, by no means
	too late to say that it enters upon the year &#8217;44 and its twenty-third volume
	with ability and zeal unabated, and that it is yet, as it has been heretofore,
	by far the handsomest, ablest, and most interesting literary Monthly issued in
	this country. Each number contains over a hundred pages, and in the Editor&#8217;s
	Table alone is often found more matter than the entire body of some of its
	rivals contains. It has a long list of zealous correspondents, bound to it not
	more by interest than affection, and numbering among them the most gifted and
	distinguished writers in the country. The &#8216;Quod Correspondence,&#8217; a novel which
	is running through the successive numbers, is one of the best works of the kind
	ever written; its scenes possess a deep dramatic interest, and throughout the
	whole, moral principles are clearly and powerfully evolved. &#8216;The Idleberg
	Papers&#8217; is the general title of another capital series, and the work is
	otherwise filled with excellent prose and generally good poetry. The &#8216;Editor&#8217;s
	Table&#8217; is by far the most racy and entertaining collection of anecdotes,
	humorous and pathetic passages, slight criticisms, etc., to be met in any
	magazine. We cordially commend the old and excellent <span
	class="special_name">Knickerbocker</span> to the continued love and patronage of
	the public.&#8217;</p>


	</div>


	<p>The <i>Evening Post</i> bestows upon the number praise equally warm and cordial. It
	adverts to its typographical appearance, with the remark that &#8216;it is beautifully
	printed; that even those parts which are put in the smallest characters are so
	distinctly impressed that the dimmest eyes may read them.&#8217; It lauds especially
	the article on &#8216;Descriptive Poetry,&#8217; the &#8216;Idleberg Papers,&#8217; the &#8216;Sketches of
	East Florida,&#8217; and some of the poetry; and the editor, <span
	class="special_name">William Cullen Bryant</span>, Esq., is kind enough to add,
	that &#8216;no part is better than the Editor&#8217;s Table, which presents as excellent a
	Salmagundi as was ever served up.&#8217; We scarcely dare claim to have <em>earned</em> these
	high encomiums; but we are anxious to evince to our subscribers, and especially
	to those new friends (and <em>their</em> friends) who have begun the year with us, that
	we shall spare no pains to <em>deserve</em> them. It will be our constant aim not only
	to <em>maintain</em> the reputation which the <span
	class="special_name">Knickerbocker</span> now sustains, but in return for the
	<em>affection</em> with which it seems to be every where regarded, and the liberal
	patronage which it has always retained, and which is now generously increased by
	our friends, to <em>enhance</em> it by every means in our power. But, to make use of
	two French words which have never before been quoted in America, to our

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
